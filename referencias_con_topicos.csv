Although AMPs have limited applications in agriculture, their potential to replace chemical pesticides could address food security and environmental concerns. Members of Bacillus sp., abundant in soil and plant microbiomes, are recognized as important sources of AMPs for their resistance and strong antimicrobial properties, making them ideal candidates for biocontrol in sustainable agriculture. To harness this potential, this study employed deep learning models to predict AMPs derived from Bacillus genomes, aiming to identify candidates with high activity against phytopathogens. Subsequently, the antimicrobial efficacy of selected candidate AMPs was experimentally validated. Results: More than 6700 Bacillus genomes were collected to identify a broad range of short peptides (10–100 amino acids), which were analyzed using advanced deep learning models, including BERT, Mamba, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Attention. These models demonstrated enhanced predictive accuracy and reliability over existing methods, and resulted in 4,993,389 potential AMPs from Bacillus genomes. Among these AMPs, two high-confidence AMPs (cAMP_1 and cAMP_2) were selected by cross-validation, and their structural stability and activity were evaluated and verified by molecular dynamics simulations and experimental assays, respectively. Both of them exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and various common agricultural fungal and bacterial pathogens. Conclusions: This high-throughput deep learning pipeline successfully uncovered novel AMPs from Bacillus genomes, which underscored the efficiency of deep learning models in identifying functional peptides. This approach could accelerate the discovery of potential AMPs for biocontrol applications in plant disease management, contributing to sustainable agriculture and reduced dependency on traditional antibiotics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Antimicrobial Peptides; Bacillus; Deep Learning; Functional Peptide Prediction; High-throughput Screening; Plant Disease Control|Desconocido|Article|Final|All Open Access; Gold Open Access|Scopus|2-s2.0-86000726174|5; 10; 12; 17; 25; 23; 14; 29; 15; 16; 29|57.0||https://orcid.org/0009-0000-1268-7047; https://orcid.org/0009-0008-5802-5725; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6570-8160; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9683-4402; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9898-3951; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7578-6509; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9991-423X; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8957-251X; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4998-1279; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2808-9986|discovery antimicrobial peptides bacillus genomes phytopathogens deep learning models|background antimicrobial peptides amps emerged potential novel class antimicrobial agents due broad microbial targeting low resistance risks although amps limited applications agriculture potential replace chemical pesticides could address food security environmental concerns members bacillus sp abundant soil plant microbiomes recognized important sources amps resistance strong antimicrobial properties making ideal candidates biocontrol sustainable agriculture harness potential study employed deep learning models predict amps derived bacillus genomes aiming identify candidates high activity phytopathogens subsequently antimicrobial efficacy selected candidate amps experimentally validated results bacillus genomes collected identify broad range short peptides amino acids analyzed using advanced deep learning models including bert mamba cnnlstm cnnattention models demonstrated enhanced predictive accuracy reliability existing methods resulted potential amps bacillus genomes among amps two highconfidence amps camp_ camp_ selected crossvalidation structural stability activity evaluated verified molecular dynamics simulations experimental assays respectively exhibited antimicrobial activity escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus various common agricultural fungal bacterial pathogens conclusions highthroughput deep learning pipeline successfully uncovered novel amps bacillus genomes underscored efficiency deep learning models identifying functional peptides approach could accelerate discovery potential amps biocontrol applications plant disease management contributing sustainable agriculture reduced dependency traditional antibiotics elsevier bv rights reserved|antimicrobial peptides bacillus deep learning functional peptide prediction highthroughput screening plant disease control|desconocido|['H., Su, Huan', 'M., Gu, Mengli', 'Z., Qu, Zechao', 'Q., Wang, Qiao', 'J., Jin, Jingjing', 'P., Lu, Peng', 'J., Zhang, Jianfeng', 'P., Cao, Peijian', 'X., Ren, Xueliang', 'J., Tao, Jiemeng']|['Su, Huan (58700933400)', 'Gu, Mengli (58866745900)', 'Qu, Zechao (58701482400)', 'Wang, Qiao (59502265400)', 'Jin, Jingjing (52463853700)', 'Lu, Peng (57188991051)', 'Zhang, Jianfeng (56600928800)', 'Cao, Peijian (24758092300)', 'Ren, Xueliang (54403502000)', 'Tao, Jiemeng (57190668394)']|['https://orcid.org/0009-0000-1268-7047', 'https://orcid.org/0009-0008-5802-5725', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6570-8160', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9683-4402', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9898-3951', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7578-6509', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9991-423X', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8957-251X', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4998-1279', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2808-9986']|['Antimicrobial Peptides', 'Bacillus', 'Deep Learning', 'Functional Peptide Prediction', 'High-throughput Screening', 'Plant Disease Control']|['Desconocido']|['antimicrobial peptides', 'bacillus', 'functional peptide prediction', 'high-throughput screening', 'plant disease control']|Discovery of antimicrobial peptides from Bacillus genomes against phytopathogens with deep learning models.

This study characterized a cacao collection (173 accessions) evaluated in Puerto Rico, examining phenotypic diversity, trait interrelationships, and performing comparative analyses with published Trinidad and Colombia datasets. We also developed machine learning (ML) models for yield prediction and identified yield-associated SNP markers. Results: The cacao collection showed significant phenotypic variation and strong intra-collection trait correlations. Comparative analyses revealed conserved trait responses across environments, notably linking susceptibility to black pod rot in Puerto Rico with Witches' Broom Disease in Colombia, suggesting a broad-spectrum disease response mechanism. Machine learning models effectively modeled yield, quantifying a hierarchy of predictor importance, with ‘Total pods’, ‘Infection rate’, and ‘Pod weight’ being the most influential. Integrating existing SNP data for 28 common accessions, multiple SNPs were identified as significantly associated with key horticultural traits, including ‘Total pods’, ‘Infection rate’, and ‘Yield’ (FDR < 0.01). Notably, a single genetic marker on chromosome 5 (TcSNP475), located within a putative zinc finger stress-associated protein gene (Tc05_t008610), was associated with both ‘Total pods’ and ‘Yield’, representing a prime target for marker-assisted selection. Conclusions: This research provides a detailed characterization of a wide germplasm collection, robust yield predictors, and a suite of novel trait-linked genetic markers, offering valuable resources for cacao breeding. These integrated findings will provide a solid foundation for targeted breeding strategies and deeper molecular investigations into the mechanisms underpinning yield and stress resilience in this vital global crop. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Cacao; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Machine Learning; Microbiology; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plant Disease; Puerto Rico; Quantitative Trait Locus; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Cacao; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci|cacao; genetics; growth, development and aging; machine learning; microbiology; phenotype; plant breeding; plant disease; Puerto Rico; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; Cacao; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci|Article|Final||Scopus|2-s2.0-105012943547|22; 5; 8; 16; 11; 1; 14; 42; 37; 18; 9|183.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1044-349X; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9714-9554; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3023-4863; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4954-6392; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6742-5853; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8504-9839; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8299-2629; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7398-9476; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4447-4104|integrated phenotypic analysis predictive modeling identification novel traitassociated loci diverse theobroma cacao collection|background cacao theobroma cacao l breeding improvement rely understanding germplasm diversity trait architecture study characterized cacao collection accessions evaluated puerto rico examining phenotypic diversity trait interrelationships performing comparative analyses published trinidad colombia datasets also developed machine learning ml models yield prediction identified yieldassociated snp markers results cacao collection showed significant phenotypic variation strong intracollection trait correlations comparative analyses revealed conserved trait responses across environments notably linking susceptibility black pod rot puerto rico witches broom disease colombia suggesting broadspectrum disease response mechanism machine learning models effectively modeled yield quantifying hierarchy predictor importance total pods infection rate pod weight influential integrating existing snp data common accessions multiple snps identified significantly associated key horticultural traits including total pods infection rate yield fdr notably single genetic marker chromosome tcsnp located within putative zinc finger stressassociated protein gene tc_t associated total pods yield representing prime target markerassisted selection conclusions research provides detailed characterization wide germplasm collection robust yield predictors suite novel traitlinked genetic markers offering valuable resources cacao breeding integrated findings provide solid foundation targeted breeding strategies deeper molecular investigations mechanisms underpinning yield stress resilience vital global crop elsevier bv rights reserved|cacao genetics growth development aging machine learning microbiology phenotype plant breeding plant disease puerto rico quantitative trait locus single nucleotide polymorphism cacao machine learning phenotype plant breeding plant diseases polymorphism single nucleotide quantitative trait loci|cacao genetics growth development aging machine learning microbiology phenotype plant breeding plant disease puerto rico quantitative trait locus single nucleotide polymorphism cacao machine learning phenotype plant breeding plant diseases polymorphism single nucleotide quantitative trait loci|['I., Baek, Insuck', 'M., Cha, Min-hyeok', 'S., Lim, Seunghyun', 'B.M., Irish, Brian M.', 'S., Oh, Sookyung', 'J., Bhatt, Jishnu', 'R.K., Upadhyay, Rakesh Kumar', 'M., Kim, Moon-sung', 'L.W., Meinhardt, Lyndel W.', 'S., Park, Sunchung']|['Baek, Insuck (55414110300)', 'Cha, Min-hyeok (57193861587)', 'Lim, Seunghyun (59506907800)', 'Irish, Brian M.

This study combines Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and machine learning (ML) to specific macronutrients, namely nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg), in fig leaves (Ficus carica L.). A dataset of 90 leaves was analyzed, with FTIR spectra (450–4000 cm⁻1) preprocessed via baseline correction and second-derivative transformations. Three ML models were evaluated using fivefold cross-validation including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting (GB), with performance assessed via root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). GB outperformed other models, achieving validation RMSE/RPD values of 0.133/1.60 (nitrogen, N), 0.0107/1.79 (phosphorus, P), 0.1328/1.65 (potassium, K), 0.0636/1.96 (magnesium, Mg), and 0.2657/1.60 (calcium, Ca). Predictions for Mg (validation R2 = 0.7351) and P (validation R2 = 0.6873) exhibited the highest accuracy, potentially attributed to their stronger or more distinct spectral features (e.g., Mg-O stretching around 1050– 1150 cm⁻1; P-O vibrations around 1240 cm⁻1). Cross-validation revealed robust generalization for GB; while mean training RMSE was very low (< 0.01 for P and Mg), validation RMSE remained relatively low, underscoring the model’s utility for screening (RPD > 1.5). Despite evidence of overfitting (training R2 ≈ 0.999 vs. validation R2 = 0.61–0.74), GB’s performance evaluated using both RMSE and RPD confirmed its superiority over RF and SVR, which showed higher errors (e.g., SVR for Ca: RMSE = 0.4574, RPD = 1.07). This study demonstrates that FTIR-ATR coupled with ML is a rapid, non-destructive alternative to conventional destructive chemical analysis and that GB’s reliability, as indicated by RPD values > 1.5, offers actionable insights for precision nutrient management in sustainable agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Fig Leaves; Ftir-atr Spectroscopy; Gradient Boosting; Machine

Three ML models were evaluated using fivefold cross-validation including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting (GB), with performance assessed via root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). GB outperformed other models, achieving validation RMSE/RPD values of 0.133/1.60 (nitrogen, N), 0.0107/1.79 (phosphorus, P), 0.1328/1.65 (potassium, K), 0.0636/1.96 (magnesium, Mg), and 0.2657/1.60 (calcium, Ca). Predictions for Mg (validation R2 = 0.7351) and P (validation R2 = 0.6873) exhibited the highest accuracy, potentially attributed to their stronger or more distinct spectral features (e.g., Mg-O stretching around 1050– 1150 cm⁻1; P-O vibrations around 1240 cm⁻1). Cross-validation revealed robust generalization for GB; while mean training RMSE was very low (< 0.01 for P and Mg), validation RMSE remained relatively low, underscoring the model’s utility for screening (RPD > 1.5). Despite evidence of overfitting (training R2 ≈ 0.999 vs. validation R2 = 0.61–0.74), GB’s performance evaluated using both RMSE and RPD confirmed its superiority over RF and SVR, which showed higher errors (e.g., SVR for Ca: RMSE = 0.4574, RPD = 1.07). This study demonstrates that FTIR-ATR coupled with ML is a rapid, non-destructive alternative to conventional destructive chemical analysis and that GB’s reliability, as indicated by RPD values > 1.5, offers actionable insights for precision nutrient management in sustainable agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|4|0.91310215|Tópico 5: crop, soil, system

Cassava is a rich plant in protein and vitamins, particularly in the leaves, and it is also employed as a substitute for rice. Since, the leaf is the most susceptible portion of a plant, it is said to be affected easily in comparison with the other parts. Therefore, the detection of plant leaf diseases may decrease the possibility that the plant will undergo additional damage. Many research works have been designed for Cassava plant leaf disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of leaf disease detection was not improved with the minimum amount of error and time. In this paper, a novel technique called Gaussian Regressed Generative Adversarial Networks based Hermitian Extreme Gradient Boosting (GRGAN-HEGB) is introduced for accurate cassava plant disease detection. The GRGAN-HEGB technique is composed of three parts: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. At first, the numbers of real cassava leaf images are collected from the Cassava Disease Classification dataset. Then, the collected cassava leaf images are preprocessed using the Gaussian Process Regressed Generative Adversarial Network (GPR-GAN) model. Feature extraction is performed by employing Continuous Hermitian Contingency Correlation (CH-CC) model to extract the most influential features such as texture, shape, and colour for disease pattern detection. Lastly, the Cophenetic Optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting classification process is performed to classify the input cassava leaf images with extracted features. As a result, the accuracy of leaf disease detection is improved with a short processing time. Experimental evaluation is carried out using the cassava disease classification dataset by considering different metrics such as disease detection accuracy, disease detection time, precision, and recall. The statistical results confirm that the proposed technique achieves higher accuracy by 12 %, precision by 2 %, and recall by 2 % with minimum disease detection processing time by 10 % than the conventional classification methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Cassava Plant Leaf Disease Diagnosis; Continuous Hermitian Contingency Correlation; Cophenetic Optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting; Gaussian Process Regressed Generative Adversarial Networks; Plant Leaves; Adversarial Networks; Cassavum Plant Leaf Disease Diagnose; Continuous Hermitian Contingency Correlation; Cophenetic Optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting; Disease Diagnosis; Gaussian Process Regressed Generative Adversarial Network; Gaussian Processes; Gradient Boosting; Hermitians; Leaf Disease; Plant Leaves; Article; Cassava; Color; Controlled Study; Disease Classification; Feature Extraction; Generative Adversarial Network; Image Processing; Measurement Accuracy; Nonhuman; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Texture Analysis; Time|Adversarial networks; Cassavum plant leaf disease diagnose; Continuous hermitian contingency correlation; Cophenetic optimized extreme gradient boosting; Disease diagnosis; Gaussian process regressed generative adversarial network; Gaussian Processes; Gradient boosting; Hermitians; Leaf disease; Plant leaves; Article; cassava; color; controlled study; disease classification; feature extraction; generative adversarial network; image processing; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; plant disease; plant leaf; texture analysis; time|Article|Final||Scopus|2-s2.0-86000145242|1; 1|139.0|||gaussian regressed generative adversarial network based hermitian extreme gradient boosting plant leaf disease detection|identifying diseases images plant leaves one important research topics field agriculture cassava rich plant protein vitamins particularly leaves also employed substitute rice since leaf susceptible portion plant said affected easily comparison parts therefore detection plant leaf diseases may decrease possibility plant undergo additional damage many research works designed cassava plant leaf disease diagnosis accuracy leaf disease detection improved minimum amount error time paper novel technique called gaussian regressed generative adversarial networks based hermitian extreme gradient boosting grganhegb introduced accurate cassava plant disease detection grganhegb technique composed three parts preprocessing feature extraction classification first numbers real cassava leaf images collected cassava disease classification dataset collected cassava leaf images preprocessed using gaussian process regressed generative adversarial network gprgan model feature extraction performed employing continuous hermitian contingency correlation chcc model extract influential features texture shape colour disease pattern detection lastly cophenetic optimized extreme gradient boosting classification process performed classify input cassava leaf images extracted features result accuracy leaf disease detection improved short processing time experimental evaluation carried using cassava disease classification dataset considering different metrics disease detection accuracy disease detection time precision recall statistical results confirm proposed technique achieves higher accuracy precision recall minimum disease detection processing time conventional classification methods elsevier bv rights reserved|cassava plant leaf disease diagnosis continuous hermitian contingency correlation cophenetic optimized extreme gradient boosting gaussian process regressed generative adversarial networks plant leaves adversarial networks cassavum plant leaf disease diagnose continuous hermitian contingency correlation cophenetic optimized extreme gradient boosting disease diagnosis gaussian process regressed generative adversarial network gaussian processes gradient boosting hermitians leaf disease plant leaves article cassava color controlled study disease classification feature extraction generative adversarial network image processing measurement accuracy nonhuman plant disease plant leaf texture analysis time|adversarial networks cassavum plant leaf disease diagnose continuous hermitian contingency correlation cophenetic optimized extreme gradient boosting disease diagnosis gaussian process regressed generative adversarial network gaussian processes gradient boosting hermitians leaf disease plant leaves article cassava color controlled study disease classification feature extraction generative adversarial network image processing measurement accuracy nonhuman plant disease plant leaf texture analysis time|['S., Prakadeswaran, S.', 'A.B., Banu, A.

Abstract: Plant breeding has traditionally relied on phenotyping to select individuals with desirable traits—a process that is both costly and time-consuming. Increasingly, breeding strategies are shifting toward precision breeding, where causal variants are directly targeted based on their effects. To predict the effects of causal variants, in silico methods are emerging as efficient alternatives or complements to mutagenesis screens. Here, we review state-of-the-art machine learning methods for predicting variant effects in plants across both coding and noncoding regions, contrasting supervised approaches in functional genomics with unsupervised methods in comparative genomics. We discuss challenges in validating predictions, and compare these methods with traditional association and comparative genomics techniques. We argue that modern sequence models extend traditional methods by generalizing across genomic contexts, fitting a unified model across loci rather than a separate model for each locus. In doing so, they address inherent limitations of traditional quantitative and evolutionary comparative genetics techniques. However, the accuracy and generalizability of sequence models heavily depend on the training data, highlighting the need for validation experiments. We point to successful applications of sequence models, especially with protein sequences, and identify areas for further improvement, especially in modeling regulatory sequences.

Identifying PPIs in plant-pathogen interactions is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant defense and pathogen virulence. However, experimental methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, prompting the use of computational techniques to complement traditional approaches. A robust ensemble model was developed using multiple sequence encodings and diverse learning algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network. The features used included auto-covariance, conjoint triad, and local descriptor schemes, which were selected based on their performance. The top three performing models were combined into an ensemble model, improving prediction accuracy to approximately 97%. The PlantPathoPPI tool, developed through this approach, was compared with existing tools using an independent test dataset, showing promising potential for PPI prediction in plant-pathogen interactions. To facilitate broad accessibility, a web-based prediction server was developed, available at https://plantpathoppi.onrender.com/, alongside a Python package on https://pypi.org/project/plantpathoppi-ml/. This research contributes significantly to the field by offering an efficient tool for predicting PPIs in plant-pathogen systems, providing valuable insights into plant diseases and supporting hypothesis-driven research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Ensemble Model;

This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based tool for predicting protein–protein interactions (PPIs) between plant-pathogen systems, addressing the challenges of experimental PPI identification. Identifying PPIs in plant-pathogen interactions is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant defense and pathogen virulence. However, experimental methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, prompting the use of computational techniques to complement traditional approaches. A robust ensemble model was developed using multiple sequence encodings and diverse learning algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network. The features used included auto-covariance, conjoint triad, and local descriptor schemes, which were selected based on their performance. The top three performing models were combined into an ensemble model, improving prediction accuracy to approximately 97%. The PlantPathoPPI tool, developed through this approach, was compared with existing tools using an independent test dataset, showing promising potential for PPI prediction in plant-pathogen interactions. To facilitate broad accessibility, a web-based prediction server was developed, available at https://plantpathoppi.onrender.com/, alongside a Python package on https://pypi.org/project/plantpathoppi-ml/. This research contributes significantly to the field by offering an efficient tool for predicting PPIs in plant-pathogen systems, providing valuable insights into plant diseases and supporting hypothesis-driven research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|2|0.78679234|Tópico 3: protein, effector, sequence

Abstract: Grain legumes, such as soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) play an important role in combating micronutrient malnutrition in the growing human population. However, plant diseases significantly reduce grain yield, causing 10–40% losses in major food crops. The genetic mechanisms associated with disease resistance in legumes have been widely studied using genomic approaches. Multi-omics data encompassing various biological layers such as the transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, and metabolome, in addition to the genome, enables researchers to gain a deeper understanding of these complementary layers and their roles in complex legume-pathogen interactions. Genomic prediction, used to select the best genotypes with desirable traits for breeding, has largely relied on genome-wide markers and statistical approaches to estimate the breeding values of individuals. Integrating multi-omics data into genomic prediction can be achieved using machine learning models, which can capture nonlinear relationships prevalent in high-dimensional data better than traditional statistical methods. This integration may enable more accurate predictions and identification of resistance mechanisms for breeding resistant legumes. Despite its potential, multi-omics integration for disease resistance prediction in legumes has been largely unexplored. In this review, we explore omics studies focusing on disease resistance in legumes and discuss how machine learning models can integrate multi-omics data for disease resistance prediction.

Consumed all around the globe due to it being rich in nutrients such as vitamins, antioxidants, and for being high in fibre. These are nutritional qualities that help with digestion, immune-system, and minimizing inflammation. It is a common issue among farmers to have to deal with various diseases in cauliflower leaves that are difficult to diagnose in their early stages. These diseases have a tendency to propagate in a really swift pace throughout entire fields worth of crops. This in-turn causes heavy losses in the harvest, and makes it much more tedious and resource-intensive to protect the crops. As a result, farmers get more likely to use high amounts of pesticides and harmful chemicals to streamline the process of getting a more reliable yield on their crops. This is not only costly, but it is also harmful both to the quality of crops and to the well-being of the environment. In this publication, we are introducing a dataset containing a considerable number of images of cauliflower leaves. This is intended to drive development on this topic at a faster pace than it is now, and to help enhance disease monitoring, diagnosis, and precautionary techniques. We collected our dataset images between November 2024 and January 2025. In this dataset, cauliflower leaves were categorized into three classes: Healthy, Insect Holes, and Black Rot, each reflecting a specific condition that impacts plant health at different stages. This dataset consists of 2,661 images. The pictures were captured at different locations in Bangladesh, under different weather conditions, dates, temperatures, and with different devices. To enhance the data quality, we used several steps to process the dataset, making sure it would reflect real-world conditions and be ready for training. The images were resized to a standard size of 3000 × 3000 pixels, brightness was adjusted to make the images more easily discernible, and we removed duplicates and poor-quality images. These actions helped ensure the dataset was in the best possible shape for effective model training. This dataset will be highly effective for agricultural research, precision agriculture, and effective management of diseases. It should help develop highly accurate machine learning models for early detection of Cauliflower leaf diseases. The dataset is employed to train deep learning models to support automated monitoring and smart decision-making in precision agriculture. This data set also has immense potential for real-time and practical use. It can be utilized to develop applications like mobile apps or automated systems where farmers can easily identify diseases at early stages and take immediate action, without the requirement of expert on-site knowledge.

Cauliflower is among the more well-known vegetables there are. Consumed all around the globe due to it being rich in nutrients such as vitamins, antioxidants, and for being high in fibre. These are nutritional qualities that help with digestion, immune-system, and minimizing inflammation. It is a common issue among farmers to have to deal with various diseases in cauliflower leaves that are difficult to diagnose in their early stages. These diseases have a tendency to propagate in a really swift pace throughout entire fields worth of crops. This in-turn causes heavy losses in the harvest, and makes it much more tedious and resource-intensive to protect the crops. As a result, farmers get more likely to use high amounts of pesticides and harmful chemicals to streamline the process of getting a more reliable yield on their crops. This is not only costly, but it is also harmful both to the quality of crops and to the well-being of the environment. In this publication, we are introducing a dataset containing a considerable number of images of cauliflower leaves. This is intended to drive development on this topic at a faster pace than it is now, and to help enhance disease monitoring, diagnosis, and precautionary techniques. We collected our dataset images between November 2024 and January 2025. In this dataset, cauliflower leaves were categorized into three classes: Healthy, Insect Holes, and Black Rot, each reflecting a specific condition that impacts plant health at different stages. This dataset consists of 2,661 images. The pictures were captured at different locations in Bangladesh, under different weather conditions, dates, temperatures, and with different devices. To enhance the data quality, we used several steps to process the dataset, making sure it would reflect real-world conditions and be ready for training. The images were resized to a standard size of 3000 × 3000 pixels, brightness was adjusted to make the images more easily discernible, and we removed duplicates and poor-quality images. These actions helped ensure the dataset was in the best possible shape for effective model training. This dataset will be highly effective for agricultural research, precision agriculture, and effective management of diseases. It should help develop highly accurate machine learning models for early detection of Cauliflower leaf diseases. The dataset is employed to train deep learning models to support automated monitoring and smart decision-making in precision agriculture. This data set also has immense potential for real-time and practical use. It can be utilized to develop applications like mobile apps or automated systems where farmers can easily identify diseases at early stages and take immediate action, without the requirement of expert on-site knowledge. This data set can also be utilized with smart farming equipment like drones and sensors to track big fields in real time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|6|0.4917862|Tópico 7: model, data, study

This study employed machine learning to optimize macronutrient concentrations during the cultivation of Phalaenopsis orchids. A dataset was generated by investigating the effects of various macronutrient levels on the morphological and biochemical traits of plantlets. An innovative iterative prediction scheme based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) was utilized to identify the optimal macronutrient levels necessary for enhancing plant morphology and biochemistry. The modeling results indicated that doubling the nitrate concentration, combined with a 2.2% increase in potassium and a 5.3% increase in phosphorus compared to the half-strength MS medium, yielded the most favorable morphological traits. Additionally, the model demonstrated that a twofold increase in nitrate, along with a 2.7% increase in potassium and a 4.7% increase in phosphorus, significantly improved biochemical characteristics, including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids. To investigate the possibility of introducing a single optimal point for the improvement of both morphological and biochemical traits, new plants were cultivated by doubling the nitrate content, a 2.5% increase in potassium, and a 5.0% increase in phosphorus, all compared with the control, i.e., half-strength MS medium. Remarkable enhancements were observed in plant physiology and biochemistry, achieving over a 50% increase in morphological traits and a 200% increase in biochemical traits. The proposed approach that effectively reduces the growth period of the orchid plantlets, can revolutionize the cultivation of plants with prolonged growth periods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Artificial Intelligence;

Despite the usage of chemical fungicides to combat the pathogen, their effectiveness remains limited in controlling blast disease. Consequently, there exists a pressing need to discover a novel natural biofungicide for efficient blast disease management. To address this challenge, we combined machine learning-based bioactivity prediction with virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the molecular interactions between forty-eight plant-derived natural compounds and the effector protein, Avr-PikE, an avirulence protein from Magnaporthe oryzae. Among the evaluated phytochemicals, Calotropin, Lupeol, and Azadirachtin emerged as the top-ranking molecules based on their favourable affinity through molecular docking with the effector. MD simulations for 100 ns were conducted to ascertain the stability and reliability of these compounds. Through classical and steered MD simulations and free energy calculations, it was revealed that these selected compounds exhibit stable and favourable energies, thereby establishing strong binding interactions with Avr-PikE. These screened natural metabolites were also found to meet crucial criteria for fungicide-likeness. To support accessibility and broader applications, we also developed a bioactivity prediction app (http://login1.cabgrid.res.in:5260/), allowing users to predict bioactivity against fungi based on our model. The efficacy of one potent compound, Lupeol, was validated through in vitro experiments, confirming its significant antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae. Such biofungicides hold promise for enhancing disease management strategies and mitigating the impact of blast disease on cereal crops. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Azadirachta Indica; Calotrophis Procera;

Magnaporthe oryzae stands as a notorious fungal pathogen responsible for causing devastating blast disease in cereals, leading to substantial reductions in grain production. Despite the usage of chemical fungicides to combat the pathogen, their effectiveness remains limited in controlling blast disease. Consequently, there exists a pressing need to discover a novel natural biofungicide for efficient blast disease management. To address this challenge, we combined machine learning-based bioactivity prediction with virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the molecular interactions between forty-eight plant-derived natural compounds and the effector protein, Avr-PikE, an avirulence protein from Magnaporthe oryzae. Among the evaluated phytochemicals, Calotropin, Lupeol, and Azadirachtin emerged as the top-ranking molecules based on their favourable affinity through molecular docking with the effector. MD simulations for 100 ns were conducted to ascertain the stability and reliability of these compounds. Through classical and steered MD simulations and free energy calculations, it was revealed that these selected compounds exhibit stable and favourable energies, thereby establishing strong binding interactions with Avr-PikE. These screened natural metabolites were also found to meet crucial criteria for fungicide-likeness. To support accessibility and broader applications, we also developed a bioactivity prediction app (http://login1.cabgrid.res.in:5260/), allowing users to predict bioactivity against fungi based on our model. The efficacy of one potent compound, Lupeol, was validated through in vitro experiments, confirming its significant antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae. Such biofungicides hold promise for enhancing disease management strategies and mitigating the impact of blast disease on cereal crops. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|2|0.57693094|Tópico 3: protein, effector, sequence

Globally, zinc deficiency affects approximately 2 billion people, leading to serious issues such as immune problems and growth delays, particularly in developing countries. In the U.S., around 10% of adolescents experienced zinc deficiency in 2021, with a higher prevalence among teenage girls. In Europe, deficiency rates are generally low but can be significant in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In Asia, particularly in rural and low-income areas, deficiency rates range from 20-30%. In Turkey, the prevalence is high due to poor nutrition. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based decision support system to determine zinc deficiency in children and adolescents aged 10-18 years. Methods: This machine learning-based study was conducted with 370 adolescents aged 10-18 years to assess their zinc deficiency. The dataset consists of 8 feature vectors and an output vector. The machine learning methods used in the analysis include logistic regression, naive bayes, decision tree (CART), K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting classifier, AdaBoost classifier, bagging classifier, random forest classifier, multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier, and XGBoost (XGB) classifier. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to assess the performance of these methods. Including specific values for these metrics, such as ""SVM achieved 94.6% accuracy,"" would allow readers to quickly compare the effectiveness of the models. Different metrics serve various purposes: Accuracy provides an overall view of performance, precision and recall highlight specific aspects, and the F1 score balances precision and recall. Results: The mean age of the patients in the dataset was 13.79 ± 1.18 years. Of the children, 64.32% (n = 238) were female and 35.68% (n = 132) were male. It was found that 62.7% (n = 232) of the children had low zinc levels, while 37.3% (n = 138) did not require zinc supplementation. Thirteen different machine learning methods were applied to a 70% training and 30% testing set. As a result, the SVM method provided the most successful outcome with 94.6% accuracy. Implementing the SVM-based system in pediatric clinics could improve efficiency and patient care by automatically detecting high-risk zinc deficiency patients based on lab results, providing early intervention alerts for faster treatment, and improving health outcomes. Highlighting these practical applications could increase the study’s appeal to healthcare professionals by demonstrating its real-world benefits. Providing detailed information on these applications would enhance the study’s clarity and practical value, making it more valuable for researchers and healthcare providers interested in AI tools for adolescent health. Conclusions: This study concluded that machine learning methods can effectively determine zinc deficiency in children. The SVM method demonstrated superior classification performance compared to the other methods. An SVM-based decision support system could be integrated into pediatric outpatient clinics to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."|Adolescents;

Genome sequencing advancements have led to the identification of a myriad of NLRs in numerous agriculturally important plant species. However, deciphering which NLRs recognize specific pathogen effectors remains challenging. Predicting NLR–effector interactions in silico will provide a more targeted approach for experimental validation, critical for elucidating function, and advancing our understanding of NLR-triggered immunity. In this study, NLR–effector protein complex structures were predicted using AlphaFold2-Multimer for all experimentally validated NLR–effector interactions reported in literature. Binding affinities- and energies were predicted using 97 machine learning models from Area-Affinity. We show that AlphaFold2-Multimer predicted structures have acceptable accuracy and can be used to investigate NLR–effector interactions in silico. Binding affinities for 58 NLR–effector complexes ranged between −8.5 and −10.6 log(K), and binding energies between −11.8 and −14.4 kcal/mol−1, depending on the Area-Affinity model used. For 2427 “forced” NLR–effector complexes, these estimates showed larger variability, enabling identification of novel NLR–effector interactions with 99% accuracy using an Ensemble machine learning model. The narrow range of binding energies- and affinities for “true” interactions suggest a specific change in Gibbs free energy, and thus conformational change, is required for NLR activation. This is the first study to provide a method for predicting NLR–effector interactions, applicable to all pathosystems. Finally, the NLR–Effector Interaction Classification (NEIC) resource can streamline research efforts by identifying NLRs important for plant–pathogen resistance, advancing our understanding of plant immunity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Effector; Effector Triggered Immunity; Nlr–effector Interactions; Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat; Plant–pathogen Interactions; Technical

Therefore, we investigated how long-term continuous cropping would impact the composition of microbial communities and their feedback to flue-cured tobacco. We selected flue-cured tobacco with contrasting agronomic traits from three fields under continuous cultivation for over a decade, where well-grown plants had 1.45, 1.28, 1.17 and 1.25 times greater height, leaf number, length and width than poorly grown tobacco, respectively. The root zone soils of flue-cured tobacco with contrasting agronomic traits were collected to analyse the community structure and network characteristics of soil bacteria and fungi. Although bacterial and fungal diversity, dominated by stochastic processes, remained invariant between contrasting agronomic traits, community composition differed significantly at the order level. Specifically, the well-grown tobacco was enriched with Micrococcales, Xanthomonadales and Eurotiales groups known for their role in organic matter degradation. In contrast, poorly grown tobacco was uniquely enriched with bacteria typically involved in nitrate cycling, such as Nitrospira, Nocardioides and Betaproteobacteria. Bacterial function prediction based on Tax4Fun2 showed that functions related to amino acid cycling were enriched in the root zone of well-grown tobacco. Additionally, the rhizosphere of well-grown tobacco exhibited a more complex bacterial network with larger network hubs than that of poorly grown tobacco. In conclusion, the enrichment of organic matter decomposers and nitrate transformers in the root zones of continuously cropped flue-cured tobacco significantly impacts agronomic traits, with a complex soil bacterial network and key network hubs playing a crucial role in maintaining tobacco growth. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Ecological Networks; Flue-cured Tobacco; Microbial Community; Plant-microbes Interaction; Agronomic Traits; Community Is; Ecological Networks; Flue-cured Tobacco; Microbial Communities; Network Hubs; Plant-microbe Interactions; Root Zone; Soil Microbial; Soil Microbial Community; Plant Diseases; Community Structure; Continuous Cropping; Cultivation; Ecological Impact; Microbial Community; Organic Matter; Rhizosphere; Tobacco|Agronomic traits; Community IS; Ecological networks; Flue-cured tobacco; Microbial communities; Network hubs; Plant-microbe interactions; Root zone; Soil microbial; Soil microbial community; Plant diseases; community structure; continuous cropping; cultivation; ecological impact; microbial community; organic matter; rhizosphere; tobacco|Article|Final||Scopus|2-s2.0-105002126751|9; 3; 33; 23; 112; 21; 4; 12; 21; 16; 9; 6; 27; 28; 31; 41|116.0||https://orcid.org/0009-0008-1491-5494; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2549-1446; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9255-7559; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8081-0569; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4590-1825; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4647-3025; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6344-4424; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7202-9601; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8970-7277; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5262-9367; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2008-143X|soil microbial variability contrasting grown fluecured tobacco longterm continuous cropping|soil microbial communities directly impacted agricultural management practices play crucial role determining crop productivity therefore investigated longterm continuous cropping would impact composition microbial communities feedback fluecured tobacco selected fluecured tobacco contrasting agronomic traits three fields continuous cultivation decade wellgrown plants times greater height leaf number length width poorly grown tobacco respectively root zone soils fluecured tobacco contrasting agronomic traits collected analyse community structure network characteristics soil bacteria fungi although bacterial fungal diversity dominated stochastic processes remained invariant contrasting agronomic traits community composition differed significantly order level specifically wellgrown tobacco enriched micrococcales xanthomonadales eurotiales groups known role organic matter degradation contrast poorly grown tobacco uniquely enriched bacteria typically involved nitrate cycling nitrospira nocardioides betaproteobacteria bacterial function prediction based taxfun showed functions related amino acid cycling enriched root zone wellgrown tobacco additionally rhizosphere wellgrown tobacco exhibited complex bacterial network larger network hubs poorly grown tobacco conclusion enrichment organic matter decomposers nitrate transformers root zones continuously cropped fluecured tobacco significantly impacts agronomic traits complex soil bacterial network key network hubs playing crucial role maintaining tobacco growth elsevier bv rights reserved|ecological networks fluecured tobacco microbial community plantmicrobes interaction agronomic traits community ecological networks fluecured tobacco microbial communities network hubs plantmicrobe interactions root zone soil microbial soil microbial community plant diseases community structure continuous cropping cultivation ecological impact microbial community organic matter rhizosphere tobacco|agronomic traits community ecological networks fluecured tobacco microbial communities network hubs plantmicrobe interactions root zone soil microbial soil microbial community plant diseases community structure continuous cropping cultivation ecological impact microbial community organic matter rhizosphere tobacco|['R., Jia, Rong', 'X., Qu, Xinyue', 'M., Chen, Min', 'Y., Xu, Yi', 'Z., Liu, Zhiyong', 'L.E.K., Peixoto, Leanne E.K.', 'Y., Lin, Yechun', 'Y., Guo, Yali', 'A., Kumar, Amit', 'J., Chen, Jie']|['Jia, Rong (58710384700)', 'Qu, Xinyue (57828555700)', 'Chen, Min (59727650700)', 'Xu, Yi (57157671900)', 'Liu, Zhiyong (58366324400)', 'Peixoto, Leanne E.K.

Predicting PDR protein is essential for understanding plant–pathogen interactions and developing strategies for crop protection. This study proposes a hybrid model for predicting and designing PDR proteins against plant-invading pathogens. Initially, we tried alignment-based approaches, such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) for similarity search and MERCI for motif search. These alignment-based approaches exhibit very poor coverage or sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, we developed alignment-free or machine learning (ML)-based methods using compositional features of proteins. Our ML-based model, developed using compositional features of proteins, achieved a maximum performance area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.91. The performance of our model improved significantly from AUROC of 0.91–0.95 when we used evolutionary information instead of protein sequence. Finally, we developed a hybrid or ensemble model that combined our best ML model with BLAST and obtained the highest AUROC of 0.98 on the validation dataset. We trained and tested our models on a training dataset and evaluated them on a validation dataset. None of the proteins in our validation dataset are more than 40% similar to proteins in the training dataset. One of the objectives of this study is to facilitate the scientific community working in plant biology.

However, due to the lack of an efficient genetic transformation system in Pst, progress in effector function studies has been slow. Here, we modeled the structures of 15,201 effectors from twelve Pst races or isolates, a Puccinia striiformis isolate, and one Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei isolate using AlphaFold2. Of these, 8,102 folds were successfully predicted, and we performed sequence- and structure-based annotations of these effectors. These effectors were classified into 410 structure clusters and 1,005 sequence clusters. Sequence lengths varied widely, with a concentration between 101-250 amino acids, and motif analysis revealed that 47% and 5.81% of the predicted effectors contain known effector motifs [Y/F/W]xC and RxLR, respectively highlighting the structural conservation across a substantial portion of the effectors. Subcellular localization predictions indicated a predominant cytoplasmic localization, with notable chloroplast and nuclear presence. Structure-guided analysis significantly enhances effector prediction efficiency as demonstrated by the 75% among 8,102 have structural annotation. The clustering and annotation prediction both based on the sequence and structure homologies allowed us to determine the adopted folding or fold families of the effectors. A common feature observed was the formation of structural homologies from different sequences. In our study, one of the comparative structural analyses revealed a new structure family with a core structure of four helices, including Pst27791, PstGSRE4, and PstSIE1, which target key wheat immune pathway proteins, impacting the host immune functions. Further comparative structural analysis showed similarities between Pst effectors and effectors from other pathogens, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50, Zt-KP4-1, and MoHrip2, highlighting a possibility of convergent evolutionary strategies, yet to be supported by further data encompassing on some evolutionarily distant species. Currently, our initial analysis is the most one on Pst effectors’ sequence, structural and annotation relationships providing a novel foundation to advance our future understanding of Pst pathogenicity and evolution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase; Glycosidase; Fungal Proteins; Origin 2022; Dynamic Response; Biological Functions; Classifieds; Computational Studies; Control Strategies; Genetic Transformation Systems; Puccinia Striiformis; Sequence Lengths; Stripe Rust; Structural Characterization; Structure-based; Immune System; Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase; Glycosidase; Proteome; Signal Peptide; Virulence Factor; Fungal Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Blumeria Graminis; Chloroplast; Effector Cell; Genetic Transformation; Machine Learning; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Melampsora Lini; Nonhuman; Pathogenicity; Phylogenetic Tree; Principal Component Analysis; Protein Database; Protein Motif; Protein Structure; Puccinia Striiformis F.

Understanding the biological functions of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) effectors is fundamental for uncovering the mechanisms of pathogenicity and variability, thereby paving the way for developing durable and effective control strategies for stripe rust. However, due to the lack of an efficient genetic transformation system in Pst, progress in effector function studies has been slow. Here, we modeled the structures of 15,201 effectors from twelve Pst races or isolates, a Puccinia striiformis isolate, and one Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei isolate using AlphaFold2. Of these, 8,102 folds were successfully predicted, and we performed sequence- and structure-based annotations of these effectors. These effectors were classified into 410 structure clusters and 1,005 sequence clusters. Sequence lengths varied widely, with a concentration between 101-250 amino acids, and motif analysis revealed that 47% and 5.81% of the predicted effectors contain known effector motifs [Y/F/W]xC and RxLR, respectively highlighting the structural conservation across a substantial portion of the effectors. Subcellular localization predictions indicated a predominant cytoplasmic localization, with notable chloroplast and nuclear presence. Structure-guided analysis significantly enhances effector prediction efficiency as demonstrated by the 75% among 8,102 have structural annotation. The clustering and annotation prediction both based on the sequence and structure homologies allowed us to determine the adopted folding or fold families of the effectors. A common feature observed was the formation of structural homologies from different sequences. In our study, one of the comparative structural analyses revealed a new structure family with a core structure of four helices, including Pst27791, PstGSRE4, and PstSIE1, which target key wheat immune pathway proteins, impacting the host immune functions. Further comparative structural analysis showed similarities between Pst effectors and effectors from other pathogens, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50, Zt-KP4-1, and MoHrip2, highlighting a possibility of convergent evolutionary strategies, yet to be supported by further data encompassing on some evolutionarily distant species. Currently, our initial analysis is the most one on Pst effectors’ sequence, structural and annotation relationships providing a novel foundation to advance our future understanding of Pst pathogenicity and evolution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|2|0.99478126|Tópico 3: protein, effector, sequence

The production rate and quality of cassava crops are affected by several diseases. However, the manual identification of diseases is challenging and requires considerable time because of the lack of field professionals and the limited availability of clear and distinct information. Consequently, the agricultural management system is seeking an efficient and lightweight method that can be deployable to edged devices for detecting diseases at an early stage. To address these issues and accurately categorize different diseases, a very effective and lightweight framework called CDDNet has been introduced. We used MobileNetV3Small framework as a backbone feature for extracting optimized, discriminating, and distinct features. These features are empirically validated at the early intermediate stage. Additionally, we modified the soft attention module to effectively prioritize the diseased regions and enhance significant cassava plant disease-related features for efficient cassava disease detection. RESULTS: Our proposed method achieved accuracies of 98.95%, 97.03%, and 98.25% on Cassava Image Dataset, Cassava Plant Disease Merged (2019–2020) Dataset, and the newly created Cassava Plant Composite Dataset, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed technique outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, parameter count, and frames per second values, ultimately making the proposed CDDNet the best one for real-time processing. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the importance of a lightweight and efficient technique for cassava disease detection and classification in a real-time environment.

However, plant infectious diseases pay significant challenges in declining both the quality and yield. Another key factor limiting crop growth worldwide is a lack of essential nutrients. Deficiencies in macronutrients (P, N, Ca, Mg and K) and micronutrients (Cu, Zn, and Mo) have a major impact on plant growth and development, ultimately leading to plant death. However, with artificial intelligence (AI), it is now possible to detect not only symptoms, but also identify the specific pathogens, understand plant–pathogen interactions, and even analyse nutrient deficiencies in both soil and plants. Thus, AI is necessitated to address these issues, which allows for real-time, accurate analysis of plant health using robots and probes, making it faster and more precise than traditional methods of plant tissue and soil testing. Advanced AI techniques—such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—are now being applied to detect infectious diseases and nutrient levels.

Deficiencies in macronutrients (P, N, Ca, Mg and K) and micronutrients (Cu, Zn, and Mo) have a major impact on plant growth and development, ultimately leading to plant death. However, with artificial intelligence (AI), it is now possible to detect not only symptoms, but also identify the specific pathogens, understand plant–pathogen interactions, and even analyse nutrient deficiencies in both soil and plants. Thus, AI is necessitated to address these issues, which allows for real-time, accurate analysis of plant health using robots and probes, making it faster and more precise than traditional methods of plant tissue and soil testing. Advanced AI techniques—such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—are now being applied to detect infectious diseases and nutrient levels. This chapter explores the current role of AI in diagnosing plant infectious diseases and identifying nutrient needs that offering guidance for effective management practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|4|0.92460304|Tópico 5: crop, soil, system

Deficiency of one of these vitamins causes growth retardation in plants. Vitamin deficiencies in lettuce grown in hydroponic systems can negatively affect plant development and create various problems. Therefore, it is critical to provide all the vitamin and mineral balances that plants need in hydroponic systems. In this study, the development of lettuce, which has an important place in daily life, was examined in detail. Deep learning techniques were applied to images of lettuce plants using various You Only Look Once (YOLO) models (YOLOV12 and YOLOV11). Various metrics were calculated for each YOLO version to evaluate performance. These metrics include precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP)50 (average accuracy), and mAP50–95 (average accuracy at different intersection over union [IoU]), thresholds). A balance was created between the classes on the lettuce images obtained using data augmentation techniques, which allowed the model to be trained more robustly. In the tests conducted with the augmented dataset, the mAP50 value of the YOLOV12 model was calculated as 0.984 and the mAP50–95 value as 0.957. This reveals the high performance of the model in correctly recognizing nutritional deficiencies. On the other hand, the YOLOV11 model achieved lower results, such as 0.975 mAP50 and 0.944 mAP50–95 in all classes. This study significantly improved the object detection performance by integrating novel attention modules into YOLOV11 and YOLOV12 models to detect nutrient deficiencies of lettuce plants early and accurately in soilless agriculture. Not only the comparison of models, but also the generalization and robustness of the model were strengthened with innovative modules that provide dynamic adaptation to environmental variables. This novel approach provides tangible contributions to both academic literature and practical applications in AI-supported early detection and yield optimization in sustainable hydroponic agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Computer Vision;

Secreted microbial signaling molecules initiate and mediate symbiosis by binding to structurally compatible plant receptors. For example, lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), produced by nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria and various fungi, are recognized by plant lysin motif receptor-like kinases (LysM-RLKs), which activate the common symbiotic pathway. Accurately predicting these molecular interactions could reveal complementary signatures underlying the initial stages of endosymbiosis. Despite the breakthrough in protein-ligand structure prediction with deep learning-based tools, such as AlphaFold3, the large size and highly flexible nature of signaling compounds like LCOs present major challenges for detailed structural characterization and binding-affinity prediction. Typical structure-/physics-based methods of ligand virtual screening are designed for small, drug-like molecules, often rely on high-resolution, experimentally determined structures of the protein receptors, and rarely achieve sufficient sampling to obtain converged thermodynamic quantities with large ligands. In this study, we developed a hybrid molecular dynamics/machine learning (MD/ML) approach capable of predicting binding affinity rankings with high accuracy in systems involving large, flexible ligands, despite limited experimental structural information. Using coarse initial structural models, the predictions using the MD/ML workflow achieved strong alignment with experimental trends, particularly in the top-affinity tier for four legume LysM-RLKs (LYR3) binding to LCOs and a chitooligosaccharide. Furthermore, the MD-based conformation selection protocol provided critical structural insights into substrate specificity and binding mechanisms. This study demonstrates a powerful method to screen for challenging cognate ligand-receptors and advance our understanding of the molecular basis of microbial colonization in plants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Lipo-chitooligosaccharides;

Microbiome assembly, structure, and dynamics significantly influence plant health. Secreted microbial signaling molecules initiate and mediate symbiosis by binding to structurally compatible plant receptors. For example, lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), produced by nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria and various fungi, are recognized by plant lysin motif receptor-like kinases (LysM-RLKs), which activate the common symbiotic pathway. Accurately predicting these molecular interactions could reveal complementary signatures underlying the initial stages of endosymbiosis. Despite the breakthrough in protein-ligand structure prediction with deep learning-based tools, such as AlphaFold3, the large size and highly flexible nature of signaling compounds like LCOs present major challenges for detailed structural characterization and binding-affinity prediction. Typical structure-/physics-based methods of ligand virtual screening are designed for small, drug-like molecules, often rely on high-resolution, experimentally determined structures of the protein receptors, and rarely achieve sufficient sampling to obtain converged thermodynamic quantities with large ligands. In this study, we developed a hybrid molecular dynamics/machine learning (MD/ML) approach capable of predicting binding affinity rankings with high accuracy in systems involving large, flexible ligands, despite limited experimental structural information. Using coarse initial structural models, the predictions using the MD/ML workflow achieved strong alignment with experimental trends, particularly in the top-affinity tier for four legume LysM-RLKs (LYR3) binding to LCOs and a chitooligosaccharide. Furthermore, the MD-based conformation selection protocol provided critical structural insights into substrate specificity and binding mechanisms. This study demonstrates a powerful method to screen for challenging cognate ligand-receptors and advance our understanding of the molecular basis of microbial colonization in plants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|2|0.9932266|Tópico 3: protein, effector, sequence

Machine learning technology has the potential to greatly improve agriculture by helping farmers make more educated decisions. However, current systems have considerable limitations.

We employed web scraping for data collection from different open source, data augmentation techniques like flip, rotation, zoom to enhance the model's performance and enhance generalization capabilities. This research focuses on developing an effective disease detection system for finger millet using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning methodologies. We analyzed with pretrained CNN architectures, such as DenseNet121, VGG16, and VGG19, using a dataset of more than thousands of labelled images collected from diverse agricultural settings. Fine tuning these models ensures optimising model's performance and achieving better accuracy. Among the tested models, DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 96.88%. Additionally, we developed a user-friendly real-time application to disease detection using Streamlit library helping the farmers to detect the disease in mobile for remote access. This study demonstrates the significant use of deep learning techniques like CNN architectures, particularly transfer learning, for developing better crop disease detection systems.

This study employed eight advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the status of micronutrient supplementation among pregnant women in 12 East African countries, using recent demographic health survey (DHS) data. The analysis involved 138,426 study samples, and algorithm performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), specificity, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among the algorithms tested, the random forest classifier emerged as the top performer in predicting micronutrient supplementation status, exhibiting excellent evaluation scores (AUC = 0.892 and accuracy = 94.0%). By analyzing mean SHAP values and performing association rule mining, we gained valuable insights into the importance of different variables and their combined impact, revealing hidden patterns within the data. Key predictors of micronutrient supplementation were the mother’s education level, employment status, number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, access to media, number of children, and religion. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop targeted strategies to improve the uptake of micronutrient supplementation. Key intervention components involve enhancing education, strengthening ANC services, and implementing comprehensive media campaigns that emphasize the importance of micronutrient supplementation. It is also crucial to consider cultural and religious sensitivities when designing interventions to ensure their effectiveness and acceptance within the specific population. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to explore and experiment with various techniques to optimize algorithm performance, leading to the identification of the most effective predictors and enhanced accuracy in predicting micronutrient supplementation status. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Demographic Health Survey;

However, CB cultivation poses a significant threat to diseases that can drastically reduce yield and quality. Detecting these diseases solely based on visual symptoms is challenging, due to the variability across different pathogens and similar symptoms caused by distinct pathogens, further complicating the detection process. Traditional methods relying solely on farmers’ ability to detect diseases is inadequate, and while engaging expert pathologists and advanced laboratories is necessary, it can also be resource intensive. To address this challenge, we present a AI-driven system for rapid and cost-effective CB disease detection, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning and object detection technologies. We utilized an extensive image dataset collected from disease hotspots in Africa and Colombia, focusing on five major diseases: Angular Leaf Spot (ALS), Common Bacterial Blight (CBB), Common Bean Mosaic Virus (CBMV), Bean Rust, and Anthracnose, covering both leaf and pod samples in real-field settings. However, pod images are only available for Angular Leaf Spot disease. The study employed data augmentation techniques and annotation at both whole and micro levels for comprehensive analysis. To train the model, we utilized three advanced YOLO architectures: YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLO-NAS. Particularly for whole leaf annotations, the YOLO-NAS model achieves the highest mAP value of up to 97.9% and a recall of 98.8%, indicating superior detection accuracy. In contrast, for whole pod disease detection, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 outperformed YOLO-NAS, with mAP values exceeding 95% and 93% recall. However, micro annotation consistently yields lower performance than whole annotation across all disease classes and plant parts, as examined by all YOLO models, highlighting an unexpected discrepancy in detection accuracy. Furthermore, we successfully deployed YOLO-NAS annotation models into an Android app, validating their effectiveness on unseen data from disease hotspots with high classification accuracy (90%).

Common beans (CB), a vital source for high protein content, plays a crucial role in ensuring both nutrition and economic stability in diverse communities, particularly in Africa and Latin America. However, CB cultivation poses a significant threat to diseases that can drastically reduce yield and quality. Detecting these diseases solely based on visual symptoms is challenging, due to the variability across different pathogens and similar symptoms caused by distinct pathogens, further complicating the detection process. Traditional methods relying solely on farmers’ ability to detect diseases is inadequate, and while engaging expert pathologists and advanced laboratories is necessary, it can also be resource intensive. To address this challenge, we present a AI-driven system for rapid and cost-effective CB disease detection, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning and object detection technologies. We utilized an extensive image dataset collected from disease hotspots in Africa and Colombia, focusing on five major diseases: Angular Leaf Spot (ALS), Common Bacterial Blight (CBB), Common Bean Mosaic Virus (CBMV), Bean Rust, and Anthracnose, covering both leaf and pod samples in real-field settings. However, pod images are only available for Angular Leaf Spot disease. The study employed data augmentation techniques and annotation at both whole and micro levels for comprehensive analysis. To train the model, we utilized three advanced YOLO architectures: YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLO-NAS. Particularly for whole leaf annotations, the YOLO-NAS model achieves the highest mAP value of up to 97.9% and a recall of 98.8%, indicating superior detection accuracy. In contrast, for whole pod disease detection, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 outperformed YOLO-NAS, with mAP values exceeding 95% and 93% recall. However, micro annotation consistently yields lower performance than whole annotation across all disease classes and plant parts, as examined by all YOLO models, highlighting an unexpected discrepancy in detection accuracy. Furthermore, we successfully deployed YOLO-NAS annotation models into an Android app, validating their effectiveness on unseen data from disease hotspots with high classification accuracy (90%). This accomplishment showcases the integration of deep learning into our production pipeline, a process known as DLOps. This innovative approach significantly reduces diagnosis time, enabling farmers to take prompt management interventions. The potential benefits extend beyond rapid diagnosis serving as an early warning system to enhance common bean productivity and quality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|6|0.46439242|Tópico 7: model, data, study

Their experimental localisation remains a frequent task, but can be resource-intensive and sometimes impossible. Hence, hundreds of studies make use of algorithms that predict a localisation based on a protein’s sequence. Their reliability across evolutionary diverse species is unknown. Here, we evaluate the performance of common algorithms (TargetP, Localizer and WoLFPSORT) for four photosynthetic eukaryotes (Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Physcomitrium patens, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) for which experimental plastid and mitochondrial proteome data is available, and 171 eukaryotes using orthology inferences. The match between predictions and experimental data ranges from 75% to as low as 2%. Results worsen as the evolutionary distance between training and query species increases, especially for plant mitochondria for which performance borders on random sampling. Specificity, sensitivity and precision analyses highlight cross-organelle errors and uncover the evolutionary divergence of organelles as the main driver of current performance issues.

In this work, we aimed to identify the genetic basis of metabolite functions during harsh environmental conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana. With machine learning algorithms we predicted stress-specific metabolomes for 23 (a)biotic stress phenotypes of 300 natural Arabidopsis accessions. The prediction models identified several aliphatic glucosinolates (GLSs) and their breakdown products to be implicated in responses to heat stress in siliques and herbivory by Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. Bivariate GWA mapping of the metabolome predictions and their respective (a)biotic stress phenotype revealed genetic associations with MAM, AOP, and GS-OH, all three involved in aliphatic GSL biosynthesis. We, therefore, investigated thrips herbivory on AOP, MAM, and GS-OH loss-of-function and/or overexpression lines. Arabidopsis accessions with a combination of MAM2 and AOP3, leading to 3-hydroxypropyl dominance, suffered less from thrips feeding damage. The requirement of MAM2 for this effect could, however, not be confirmed with an introgression line of ecotypes Cvi and Ler, most likely due to other, unknown susceptibility factors in the Ler background. However, AOP2 and GS-OH, adding alkenyl or hydroxy-butenyl groups, respectively, did not have major effects on thrips feeding. Overall, this study illustrates the complex implications of aliphatic GSL diversity in plant responses to heat stress and a cell-content-feeding herbivore. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|(a)biotic Stresses; Aop; Mam; Metabolomics; Quantitative Genetics; Arabidopsis Proteins; Glucosinolates; Cell Culture; Plant Diseases; (a)biotic Stress; Aop; Biotic Stress; Bivariate; Glucosinolates; Heat Stress; Mam; Metabolomics; Plant Response; Quantitative Genetic; Metabolites; Biosynthesis; Breakdown; Feeding; Heat; Mapping; Organizations; Plants; Stresses; Arabidopsis Protein; Glucosinolate; Animal; Arabidopsis; Chromosomal Mapping; Genetics; Heat Shock Response; Herbivory; Metabolism; Metabolome; Phenotype; Physiology; Thysanoptera; Animals; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chromosome Mapping; Heat-shock Response; Herbivory; Metabolome; Phenotype|Cell culture; Plant diseases; (a)biotic stress; AOP; Biotic stress; Bivariate; Glucosinolates; Heat stress; MAM; Metabolomics; Plant response; Quantitative genetic; Metabolites; Biosynthesis; Breakdown; Feeding; Heat; Mapping; Organizations; Plants; Stresses; Arabidopsis protein; glucosinolate; animal; Arabidopsis; chromosomal mapping; genetics; heat shock response; herbivory; metabolism; metabolome; phenotype; physiology; Thysanoptera; Animals; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chromosome Mapping; Heat-Shock Response; Herbivory; Metabolome; Phenotype|Article|Final|All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access|Scopus|2-s2.0-85204763297|2; 7; 20; 0; 47; 48; 15; 66; 44; 65; 121; 14|378.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0095-7374; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7179-1733; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5799-2301; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8918-0711; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8161-9811; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1281-5624; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0603-1508; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3672-2921; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8565-8896; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0379-5473|bivariate gwa mapping reveals associations aliphatic glucosinolates plant responses thrips heat stress|although plants harbor huge phytochemical diversity fraction plant metabolites functionally characterized work aimed identify genetic basis metabolite functions harsh environmental conditions arabidopsis thaliana machine learning algorithms predicted stressspecific metabolomes abiotic stress phenotypes natural arabidopsis accessions prediction models identified several aliphatic glucosinolates glss breakdown products implicated responses heat stress siliques herbivory western flower thrips frankliniella occidentalis bivariate gwa mapping metabolome predictions respective abiotic stress phenotype revealed genetic associations mam aop gsoh three involved aliphatic gsl biosynthesis therefore investigated thrips herbivory aop mam gsoh lossoffunction andor overexpression lines arabidopsis accessions combination mam aop leading hydroxypropyl dominance suffered less thrips feeding damage requirement mam effect could however confirmed introgression line ecotypes cvi ler likely due unknown susceptibility factors ler background however aop gsoh adding alkenyl hydroxybutenyl groups respectively major effects thrips feeding overall study illustrates complex implications aliphatic gsl diversity plant responses heat stress cellcontentfeeding herbivore elsevier bv rights reserved|abiotic stresses aop mam metabolomics quantitative genetics arabidopsis proteins glucosinolates cell culture plant diseases abiotic stress aop biotic stress bivariate glucosinolates heat stress mam metabolomics plant response quantitative genetic metabolites biosynthesis breakdown feeding heat mapping organizations plants stresses arabidopsis protein glucosinolate animal arabidopsis chromosomal mapping genetics heat shock response herbivory metabolism metabolome phenotype physiology thysanoptera animals arabidopsis proteins chromosome mapping heatshock response herbivory metabolome phenotype|cell culture plant diseases abiotic stress aop biotic stress bivariate glucosinolates heat stress mam metabolomics plant response quantitative genetic metabolites biosynthesis breakdown feeding heat mapping organizations plants stresses arabidopsis protein glucosinolate animal arabidopsis chromosomal mapping genetics heat shock response herbivory metabolism metabolome phenotype physiology thysanoptera animals arabidopsis proteins chromosome mapping heatshock response herbivory metabolome phenotype|['B., Arouisse, Bader', 'M.P.M., Thoen, Manus P.M.', 'W., Kruijer, Willem', 'J.F., Kunst, Jonathan F.', 'M.A., Jongsma, Maarten A.', 'J.J., Keurentjes, Joost J.B.', 'R., Kooke, Rik', 'R.C.H., de Vos, Ric C.H.', 'R., Mumm, Roland', 'F.A., van Eeuwijk, Fred Antonis']|['Arouisse, Bader (57214931146)', 'Thoen, Manus P.M.

Overall, this study illustrates the complex implications of aliphatic GSL diversity in plant responses to heat stress and a cell-content-feeding herbivore. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|2|0.9375366|Tópico 3: protein, effector, sequence

The advancement of deep learning algorithms in precision agriculture holds the key to enabling the early classification of plant diseases, thereby leading to enhanced crop yields and ultimately stabilizing food security. In the coarse-grained label discrimination task of weak supervision learning, high-quality semantic features contain abundant semantic description information, which plays a crucial role in constructing a precise description of plant disease discrimination in tanglesome field circumstances and directly influences the performance of neural networks. Thus, a multiattention IBN anti-aliasing neural network (MAIANet) was proposed to improve the classification accuracy of cassava leaf disease classification by improving the feature quality in the coarseness label classification task. The proposed MAIANet neural network includes two innovative approaches. First, the multiattention method was designed to scale the feature signals twice to adjust the angular frequency of the feature signals in the residual branch for optimal feature fitting within the residual unit. Second, the anti-aliasing block extracts the high-frequency component feature and optimizes the quantization result of the pooling operation to depress the aliasing signal in the down-sampled feature maps. When the proposed method was tested and validated on the cassava dataset, the results showed that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method significantly improved, with an accuracy of 95.83 %, a loss of 1.720, and an F1-score of 0.9585, outperforming V2-ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B5, RepVGG-B3g4, and AlexNet with significant margins.

Leaf diseases caused by climate change and other factors have significantly reduced fruit production. Deep learning methods for segmenting leaf diseases can effectively mitigate this issue. However, challenges such as leaf folding, jaggedness, and light shading make edge feature extraction difficult, affecting segmentation accuracy. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method based on EFS-Former. The expanded local detail (ELD) module extends the model’s receptive field by expanding the convolution, better handling fine spots and effectively reducing information loss. H-attention reduces computational redundancy by superimposing multi-layer convolutions, significantly improving feature filtering. The parallel fusion architecture effectively utilizes the different feature extraction intervals of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer encoders, achieving comprehensive feature extraction and effectively fusing detailed and semantic information in the channel and spatial dimensions within the feature fusion module (FFM). Experiments show that, compared to DeepLabV3+, this method achieves 10.78%, 9.51%, 0.72%, and 8.00% higher scores for mean intersection over union (mIoU), mean pixel accuracy (mPA), accuracy (Acc), and F_score, respectively, while having 1.78 M fewer total parameters and 0.32 G lower floating point operations per second (FLOPS). Additionally, it effectively calculates the ratio of leaf area occupied by spots. This method is also effective in calculating the disease period by analyzing the ratio of leaf area occupied by diseased spots.

However, identifying effector proteins remains challenging, in part because they lack common sequence motifs. Here, we introduce Fungtion (Fungal effector prediction), a toolkit leveraging a hybrid framework to accurately predict and visualize fungal effectors. By combining global patterns learned from pretrained protein language models with refined information from known effectors, Fungtion achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. Additionally, the interactive visualizations we have developed enable researchers to explore both sequence- and high-level relationships between the predicted and known effectors, facilitating effector function discovery, annotation, and hypothesis formulation regarding plant-pathogen interactions. We anticipate Fungtion to be a valuable resource for biologists seeking deeper insights into fungal effector functions and for computational biologists aiming to develop future methodologies for fungal effector prediction: https://step3.erc.monash.edu/Fungtion/. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Fungal Effector Prediction;

Fungal pathogens pose significant threats to plant health by secreting effectors that manipulate plant-host defences. However, identifying effector proteins remains challenging, in part because they lack common sequence motifs. Here, we introduce Fungtion (Fungal effector prediction), a toolkit leveraging a hybrid framework to accurately predict and visualize fungal effectors. By combining global patterns learned from pretrained protein language models with refined information from known effectors, Fungtion achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. Additionally, the interactive visualizations we have developed enable researchers to explore both sequence- and high-level relationships between the predicted and known effectors, facilitating effector function discovery, annotation, and hypothesis formulation regarding plant-pathogen interactions. We anticipate Fungtion to be a valuable resource for biologists seeking deeper insights into fungal effector functions and for computational biologists aiming to develop future methodologies for fungal effector prediction: https://step3.erc.monash.edu/Fungtion/. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|2|0.99117804|Tópico 3: protein, effector, sequence

As TD symptoms are vague and overlap with other disorders, we aim to identify predictors of recurrent TD and failure to collect B1 labs. Methods: We analyzed a large sample of data from patients with MBS (n = 878) to identify potential predictors of TD risk. We modeled recurrent TD and failure to collect B1 labs using classical statistical and machine learning (ML) techniques. Results: We identified clusters of labs associated with increased risk of recurrent TD: micronutrient deficiencies, abnormal blood indices, malnutrition, and fluctuating electrolyte levels (aIRR range: 1.62–4.68). Additionally, demographic variables associated with lower socioeconomic status were predictive of recurrent TD. ML models predicting characteristics associated with failure to collect B1 labs achieved 75–81% accuracy, indicating that clinicians may fail to match symptoms with the underlying condition. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that both clinical and social factors can increase the risk of life-threatening TD episodes in some MBS patients. Identifying these indicators can help with diagnosis and treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Bariatric Surgery; Bayesian Network; Machine Learning; Micronutrient Deficiency; Random Forest;

Introduction: Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency (TD) after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is often insidious and, if unrecognized, can lead to irreversible damage or death. As TD symptoms are vague and overlap with other disorders, we aim to identify predictors of recurrent TD and failure to collect B1 labs. Methods: We analyzed a large sample of data from patients with MBS (n = 878) to identify potential predictors of TD risk. We modeled recurrent TD and failure to collect B1 labs using classical statistical and machine learning (ML) techniques. Results: We identified clusters of labs associated with increased risk of recurrent TD: micronutrient deficiencies, abnormal blood indices, malnutrition, and fluctuating electrolyte levels (aIRR range: 1.62–4.68). Additionally, demographic variables associated with lower socioeconomic status were predictive of recurrent TD. ML models predicting characteristics associated with failure to collect B1 labs achieved 75–81% accuracy, indicating that clinicians may fail to match symptoms with the underlying condition. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that both clinical and social factors can increase the risk of life-threatening TD episodes in some MBS patients. Identifying these indicators can help with diagnosis and treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|5|0.6912403|Tópico 6: soybean, vegetable, learningbased

Plant resistance to Ss pertains to quantitative disease resistance (QDR) controlled by multiple minor genes. Genome-wide identification of genes involved in QDR to Ss is yet to be conducted. In this study, we integrated several assays including genome-wide association study (GWAS), multi-omics co-localization, and machine learning prediction to identify, on a genome-wide scale, genes involved in the oilseed rape QDR to Ss. Employing GWAS and multi-omics co-localization, we identified seven resistance-associated loci (RALs) associated with oilseed rape resistance to Ss. Furthermore, we developed a machine learning algorithm and named it Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis and Machine Learning for Target Gene Prediction (iMAP), which integrates multi-omics data to rapidly predict disease resistance-related genes within a broad chromosomal region. Through iMAP based on the identified RALs, we revealed multiple calcium signaling genes related to the QDR to Ss. Population-level analysis of selective sweeps and haplotypes of variants confirmed the positive selection of the predicted calcium signaling genes during evolution. Overall, this study has developed an algorithm that integrates multi-omics data and machine learning methods, providing a powerful tool for predicting target genes associated with specific traits. Furthermore, it makes a basis for further understanding the role and mechanisms of calcium signaling genes in the QDR to Ss. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Calcium Signaling; Gwas; Machine

Corn production is highly dependent on the health of the corn plant. Infected plants will decrease corn plant productivity. Usually, corn farmers use conventional methods to control diseases in corn plants. Still, these methods are not effective and efficient because they require a long time and a lot of human labor. Deep learning-based plant disease detection has recently been used for early disease detection in agriculture. In this work, we used convolutional neural network algorithms, namely YOLO-v5 and YOLO-v8, to detect infected corn leaves in the public data set called ‘Corn Leaf Infection Data set’ from the Kaggle repository. We compared the mean average precision (mAP) of mAP 50 and mAP 50-95 between YOLO-v5 and YOLO-v8. YOLO-v8 showed better accuracy at an mAP 50 of 0.965 and an mAP 50-95 of 0.727. YOLO-v8 also showed a higher detection number of 12 detections than YOLO-v5 at 11 detections. Both YOLO algorithms required about 2.49 to 3.75 hours to detect the infected corn leaves.

The challenge lies in the absence of early visible symptoms for timely detection and management. While hyperspectral imaging technologies have been successfully applied to improve screening for some plant health indicators and diseases, they have not yet been successfully used for crown rot disease detection. This study endeavoured to harness hyperspectral imaging technologies for early-stage, high-throughput, accurate, economical, and non-destructive detection of crown rot disease. Four common Australian commercial wheat varieties with different resistance levels were chosen for study, including Aurora, Yitpi, Emu Rock and Trojan. Three different hyperspectral cameras, covering various wavelength ranges, were tested from both side-view and top-view. Four types of input data for support vector machine classification were tested, including reflectance and the other three derived forms namely hyper-hue, standard normal variate, and principal components. The experimental results showed that hyperspectral imaging technologies can successfully diagnose infected plants in a greenhouse approximately 30 days after infection when there were no visible symptoms on shoots, and the hyper-hue and standard normal variate data transformation methods achieved high F1 scores above 0.75. By discovering key wavelengths, we found that hyperspectral imaging achieved early detection by uncovering biological stress related to photosynthetic activities, and limited absorption of water, protein and starch synthesis. These findings represent a critical advance towards establishing a hyperspectral imaging system for crown rot detection, thereby facilitating disease management and breeding resistant varieties. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Computer Vision; Crown Rot; Hyperspectral Imaging Technologies; Machine Learning; Plant Phenotyping; Biosynthesis; Computer Vision; Diagnosis; Learning Systems; Machine Components; Metadata; Support Vector Machines; Water Absorption; Crown Rot; Early Diagnosis; Fungal Pathogen; Hyperspectral Imaging Technologies; Machine-learning; Plant Phenotyping; Rot Disease; Standard Normal Variates; Wheat Production; Yield Loss; Hyperspectral Imaging; Computer Vision; Crown Rot; Equipment; Imaging Method; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Protein; Support Vector Machine; Wheat; Aurora [central Luzon]|Biosynthesis; Computer vision; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Machine components; Metadata; Support vector machines; Water absorption; Crown rot; Early diagnosis; Fungal pathogen; Hyperspectral imaging technologies; Machine-learning; Plant phenotyping; Rot disease; Standard normal variates; Wheat production; Yield loss; Hyperspectral imaging; computer vision; crown rot; equipment; imaging method; machine learning; phenotype; protein; support vector machine; wheat; Aurora [Central Luzon]|Article|Final|All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access|Scopus|2-s2.0-85181131486|12; 22; 14; 1; 26; 14; 26|206.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2763-8736; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9551-8755; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9853-9893; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8613-199X; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7608-6870; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9477-4132|hyperspectral imaging detects biological stress wheat early diagnosis crown rot disease|crown rot caused stubblesoil fungal pathogen threatens wheat production leading significant yield losses challenge lies absence early visible symptoms timely detection management hyperspectral imaging technologies successfully applied improve screening plant health indicators diseases yet successfully used crown rot disease detection study endeavoured harness hyperspectral imaging technologies earlystage highthroughput accurate economical nondestructive detection crown rot disease four common australian commercial wheat varieties different resistance levels chosen study including aurora yitpi emu rock trojan three different hyperspectral cameras covering various wavelength ranges tested sideview topview four types input data support vector machine classification tested including reflectance three derived forms namely hyperhue standard normal variate principal components experimental results showed hyperspectral imaging technologies successfully diagnose infected plants greenhouse approximately days infection visible symptoms shoots hyperhue standard normal variate data transformation methods achieved high f scores discovering key wavelengths found hyperspectral imaging achieved early detection uncovering biological stress related photosynthetic activities limited absorption water protein starch synthesis findings represent critical advance towards establishing hyperspectral imaging system crown rot detection thereby facilitating disease management breeding resistant varieties elsevier bv rights reserved|computer vision crown rot hyperspectral imaging technologies machine learning plant phenotyping biosynthesis computer vision diagnosis learning systems machine components metadata support vector machines water absorption crown rot early diagnosis fungal pathogen hyperspectral imaging technologies machinelearning plant phenotyping rot disease standard normal variates wheat production yield loss hyperspectral imaging computer vision crown rot equipment imaging method machine learning phenotype protein support vector machine wheat aurora central luzon|biosynthesis computer vision diagnosis learning systems machine components metadata support vector machines water absorption crown rot early diagnosis fungal pathogen hyperspectral imaging technologies machinelearning plant phenotyping rot disease standard normal variates wheat production yield loss hyperspectral imaging computer vision crown rot equipment imaging method machine learning phenotype protein support vector machine wheat aurora central luzon|['Y., Xie, Yiting', 'D.C., Plett, Darren Craig', 'M.L., Evans, Margaret L.', 'T., Garrard, Tara', 'M., Butt, Mark', 'K.D., Clarke, Kenneth D.', 'H., Liu, Huajian']|['Xie, Yiting (57747831100)', 'Plett, Darren Craig (35797231900)', 'Evans, Margaret L.

This provides a rich data base for the application of deep learning in biological sequence classification. For predicting and analyzing the biological functions of DNA, RNA, proteins and peptides, sequence-based prediction and analysis play a crucial role. Especially in the field of RNA, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an indispensable role in regulating biological activities, and thus their identification and prediction are important for a deeper understanding of biological processes. In order to achieve more accurate predictions, an improved deep learning model is proposed in this study.

With the rapid development of biotechnology, the number of biological sequences is growing explosively. This provides a rich data base for the application of deep learning in biological sequence classification. For predicting and analyzing the biological functions of DNA, RNA, proteins and peptides, sequence-based prediction and analysis play a crucial role. Especially in the field of RNA, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an indispensable role in regulating biological activities, and thus their identification and prediction are important for a deeper understanding of biological processes. In order to achieve more accurate predictions, an improved deep learning model is proposed in this study. The model treats plant lncRNA sequences as natural text, utilizes the BERT model for pre-training, and combines with convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and prediction. The experimental results show that the CNN model trained by BERT exhibits higher accuracy and stability in lncRNA prediction compared with traditional machine learning methods such as SVM, LR, and K-NN.

All these features make it a healthy addition to a balanced diet. Apples come in a large range of colors, flavors, and varieties. There are several types of diseases both bacterial and fungal along with other types of nutritional and soil diseases that hamper the production of apple crops. A few common types of fungal diseases include Apple rot, rust, and scab. Timely identification and proper treatment can save apple crops in early stages of disease progression, saving the crop and not digging a hole in the pocket of the farmer. Until last century manual identification methods were more popular but they were very laborious, time-consuming, and the accuracy was not up to the mark. 21st century marks the use of machine learning and deep learning in almost all aspects of human life including early identification of disease in several plants including Apple. In this paper authors analyze and evaluate what are the current trends in detection of fungal diseases of Apple plants. Out of several types of Apple diseases three main types were chosen to conduct this review and those diseases are rust, scab, and rot. The primary aim of this review article is to analyze the use of various machine learning tools like CNN (convolutional neural network), support vector machine, and k nearest neighbor for the detection of fruit and leaf diseases under these three plant disease categories of Apple. An early detection will ensure early curative and remedial measures which will save the crop from getting destroyed due to the above diseases and will save the farmer from huge losses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Apple Fungal Diseases; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Rot; Rust; Scab; Deep Learning; Support Vector Machines; Apple Fungal Disease; Dietary Fibre; Disease Detection; Fungal Disease; Machine-learning; Macro-and Micronutrients; Rot; Rust; Scab; Fruits|Deep learning; Support vector machines; Apple fungal disease; Dietary fibre; Disease detection; Fungal disease; Machine-learning; Macro-and micronutrients; Rot; Rust; Scab; Fruits|Conference paper|Final||Scopus|2-s2.0-85219302411|1; 13|||https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4012-8127; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9312-4069|review fungal diseases detection apple plant using machine learning|apple common fruit rich antioxidants dietary fiber several vitamins large range macro micronutrients features make healthy addition balanced diet apples come large range colors flavors varieties several types diseases bacterial fungal along types nutritional soil diseases hamper production apple crops common types fungal diseases include apple rot rust scab timely identification proper treatment save apple crops early stages disease progression saving crop digging hole pocket farmer last century manual identification methods popular laborious timeconsuming accuracy mark st century marks use machine learning deep learning almost aspects human life including early identification disease several plants including apple paper authors analyze evaluate current trends detection fungal diseases apple plants several types apple diseases three main types chosen conduct review diseases rust scab rot primary aim review article analyze use various machine learning tools like cnn convolutional neural network support vector machine k nearest neighbor detection fruit leaf diseases three plant disease categories apple early detection ensure early curative remedial measures save crop getting destroyed due diseases save farmer huge losses elsevier bv rights reserved|apple fungal diseases deep learning machine learning rot rust scab deep learning support vector machines apple fungal disease dietary fibre disease detection fungal disease machinelearning macroand micronutrients rot rust scab fruits|deep learning support vector machines apple fungal disease dietary fibre disease detection fungal disease machinelearning macroand micronutrients rot rust scab fruits|['S., Gupta, Shivani', 'P., Rani, Pooja']|['Gupta, Shivani (59662247900)', 'Rani, Pooja (57217990609)']|['https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4012-8127', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9312-4069']|['Apple Fungal Diseases', 'Deep Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Rot', 'Rust', 'Scab', 'Deep Learning', 'Support Vector Machines', 'Apple Fungal Disease', 'Dietary Fibre', 'Disease Detection', 'Fungal Disease', 'Machine-learning', 'Macro-and Micronutrients', 'Rot', 'Rust', 'Scab', 'Fruits']|['Deep learning', 'Support vector machines', 'Apple fungal disease', 'Dietary fibre', 'Disease detection', 'Fungal disease', 'Machine-learning', 'Macro-and micronutrients', 'Rot', 'Rust', 'Scab', 'Fruits']|['apple fungal diseases', 'rot', 'rust', 'scab', 'support vector machines', 'apple fungal disease', 'dietary fibre', 'disease detection', 'fungal disease', 'machine-learning', 'macro-and micronutrients', 'rot', 'rust', 'scab', 'fruits']|A Review on Fungal Diseases Detection in Apple Plant using Machine Learning.

Nevertheless, identification and categorization of nutrient deficiencies in hydroponic lettuce are still challenging, specifically, when training deep learning models for low power 'Edge' IoT devices such as smart mobile phones and Raspberry Pi. Current methods are challenging due to high computational complexity, high power consumption, and inadequate utilization of resources, which hinders real-life implementation in embedded systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents an intelligent, highly efficient approach for the identification of nutrient deficiencies in hydroponic lettuce using advanced algorithms and a Consensus Multi-Dilated Adaptive Network (CMDA-Net). The proposed model harnesses or combines many of the current best-known or best performing approaches to yield a proper feature extraction and classification. This approach takes advantage of deep neural networks including VGG-16, Residual Attention Network (RAN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a multi-dilated convolutional network to improve spatial feature learning while at the same time reducing computational cost. These features are then passed through LSTM network that help capture temporal information control and ensure that lettuce deficiencies are correctly classified. The entire system structure is enhanced through the new Improvised Honey Badger Algorithm (I-HBA), which adjusts specific networks' parameters for maximum effectiveness with minimal resource consumption. Many experiments were carried out on Lettuce NPK dataset which contains test images of Fully Nutritional, Nitrogen Deficient, Phosphorus Deficient and Potassium Deficient lettuce.

Soybean (Glycine max), a key contributor to global plant-based protein supplies, requires ongoing yield enhancements to keep pace with increasing demand. Precise, on-plant seed counting and localization may catalyze breeding selection of shoot architectures and seed localization patterns related to superior performance in high planting density and contribute to increased yield. Traditional manual counting and localization methods are labor-intensive and prone to error, necessitating more efficient approaches for yield prediction and seed distribution analysis. To solve this, we propose MSANet: a novel deep learning framework tailored for counting and localization of soybean seeds on mature field-grown soy plants. A multi-scale attention map mechanism was applied to maximize model performance in seed counting and localization in soybean breeding fields. We compared our model with a previous state-of-the-art model using the benchmark dataset and an enlarged dataset, including various soybean genotypes. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on all datasets across various soybean genotypes on both counting and localization tasks. Furthermore, our model also performed well on in-canopy 360° video, dramatically increasing data collection efficiency.

The increase in the global population is leading to a doubling of the demand for protein. Soybean (Glycine max), a key contributor to global plant-based protein supplies, requires ongoing yield enhancements to keep pace with increasing demand. Precise, on-plant seed counting and localization may catalyze breeding selection of shoot architectures and seed localization patterns related to superior performance in high planting density and contribute to increased yield. Traditional manual counting and localization methods are labor-intensive and prone to error, necessitating more efficient approaches for yield prediction and seed distribution analysis. To solve this, we propose MSANet: a novel deep learning framework tailored for counting and localization of soybean seeds on mature field-grown soy plants. A multi-scale attention map mechanism was applied to maximize model performance in seed counting and localization in soybean breeding fields. We compared our model with a previous state-of-the-art model using the benchmark dataset and an enlarged dataset, including various soybean genotypes. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on all datasets across various soybean genotypes on both counting and localization tasks. Furthermore, our model also performed well on in-canopy 360° video, dramatically increasing data collection efficiency. We also propose a technique that enables previously inaccessible insights into the phenotypic and genetic diversity of single plant vertical seed distribution, which may accelerate the breeding process.

Unlike other fruit trees, kiwi trees are vine plants that require abundant mineral nutrients during their key growth period. Inadequate management can easily lead to nutrient deficiencies, which not only affect the health of the trees but also impact the yield and quality of kiwis. Therefore, real-time monitoring of tree growth health is essential. To achieve fast and large-scale monitoring of overall growth and health in kiwi orchards, the drone was used to capture multispectral images of orchards, and then Pix4Dmapper software was utilized to splice UAV multispectral images for orthophoto maps and radiation correction on canopy leaves. The segmented orthophoto images were used as samples from 420 regions. The maximum inter-class variance (Otsu) method was employed to segment canopy leaves from soil backgrounds in the sample images, enabling measurement of canopy SPAD values for constructing a multispectral dataset. Firstly, outliers within the dataset were detected by using box plot analysis and subsequently removed as abnormal samples. Next, based on data characteristics derived from multi-channel images, feature values such as change rates between adjacent channels and 23 kinds of common vegetation indices were extracted, as well as their combination, to serve as sample feature values. Then three feature screening algorithms, including CARS, LARS, and IRIV were applied to optimize these features accordingly. Eight modeling methods, partial least square regression (PLSR) , support vector regression ( SVR ) , ridge regression ( RR ) , multiple linear regression ( MLR ) , extreme gradient boosting ( XGBoost) , least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression ( Lasso ) , random forest regression ( RFR) , and Gaussian process regression ( GPR) , were employed to construct models for identifying canopy chlorophyll content in macaque peach orchards. Finally, the performance of the 24 models constructed with different sample features was compared and analyzed. The experimental results showed that GPR model had the best performance among the models based on the change rate of adjacent channels, R2 and RMSE were 0. 770 and 3. 044, respectively. Among the models based on the combination of vegetation index and adjacent channel change rate, GPR model also had the best performance, R2 and RMSE were 0.783 and 2.957, respectively. The XGBoost model based on vegetation index was the best among all models, R2 and RMSE were 0.787 and 2.933, respectively. Consequently, the intelligent detection model utilizing UAV remote sensing enabled accurate assessment of orchard canopy chlorophyll content while facilitating analysis of orchard health status to provide decision support for subsequent intelligent orchard management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Chlorophyll Content;

MN deficiency is a significant public health problem, especially in developing countries like Ethiopia. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence using advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning. Therefore, this study aimed to use advanced supervised algorithms to predict the micronutrient intake status in Ethiopian children aged 6–23 months. Methods: A total weighted of 2,499 children aged 6–23 months from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data set were utilized. The data underwent preprocessing, with 80% of the observations used for training and 20% for testing the model. Twelve machine learning algorithms were employed. To select best predictive model, their performance was assessed using different evaluation metrics in Python software. The Boruta algorithm was used to select the most relevant features. Besides, seven data balancing techniques and three hyper parameter tuning methods were employed. To determine the association between independent and targeted feature, association rule mining was conducted using the a priori algorithm in R software. Results: According to the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, out of 2,499 weighted children aged 12–23 months, 1,728 (69.15%) had MN intake. The random forest, catboost, and light gradient boosting algorithm outperformed in predicting MN intake status among all selected classifiers. Region, wealth index, place of delivery, mothers’ occupation, child age, fathers’ educational status, desire for more children, access to media exposure, religion, residence, and antenatal care (ANC) follow-up were the top attributes to predict MN intake. Association rule mining was identified the top seven best rules that most frequently associated with MN intake among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia. Conclusion: The random forest, catboost, and light gradient boosting algorithm achieved a highest performance and identifying the relevant predictors of MN intake. Therefore, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop targeted interventions to enhance the uptake of micronutrient supplementation among children. Customizing strategies based on identified association rules has the potential to improve child health outcomes and decrease the impact of micronutrient deficiencies in Ethiopia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Children; Ethiopia; Machine Learning Algorithm; Micronutrient Supplementation; Prediction|Desconocido|Article|Final|All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access|Scopus|2-s2.0-85196790980|10; 3; 1; 20; 3; 5; 5; 12|121.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8195-3011; https://orcid.org/0009-0003-1685-983X; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0833-2504; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9902-7921; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1522-7905; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4927-7556; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4666-1114|employing advanced supervised machine learning approaches predicting micronutrient intake status among children aged months ethiopia|background although micronutrients mns important childrens growth development intake received enough attention mn deficiency significant public health problem especially developing countries like ethiopia however lack empirical evidence using advanced statistical methods machine learning therefore study aimed use advanced supervised algorithms predict micronutrient intake status ethiopian children aged months methods total weighted children aged months ethiopia demographic health survey data set utilized data underwent preprocessing observations used training testing model twelve machine learning algorithms employed select best predictive model performance assessed using different evaluation metrics python software boruta algorithm used select relevant features besides seven data balancing techniques three hyper parameter tuning methods employed determine association independent targeted feature association rule mining conducted using priori algorithm r software results according ethiopia demographic health survey weighted children aged months mn intake random forest catboost light gradient boosting algorithm outperformed predicting mn intake status among selected classifiers region wealth index place delivery mothers occupation child age fathers educational status desire children access media exposure religion residence antenatal care anc followup top attributes predict mn intake association rule mining identified top seven best rules frequently associated mn intake among children aged months ethiopia conclusion random forest catboost light gradient boosting algorithm achieved highest performance identifying relevant predictors mn intake therefore policymakers healthcare providers develop targeted interventions enhance uptake micronutrient supplementation among children customizing strategies based identified association rules potential improve child health outcomes decrease impact micronutrient deficiencies ethiopia elsevier bv rights reserved|children ethiopia machine learning algorithm micronutrient supplementation prediction|desconocido|['A.B., Zemariam, Alemu Birara', 'M.A., Adisu, Molalign Aligaz', 'A.A., Habesse, Aklilu Abera', 'B.B., Abate, Biruk Beletew', 'M., Azmeraw, Molla', 'W.T., Wondie, Wubet Tazeb', 'A.W., Alamaw, Addis Wondmagegn', 'H.S., Ngusie, Habtamu Setegn']|['Zemariam, Alemu Birara (57211768439)', 'Adisu, Molalign Aligaz (57222321507)', 'Habesse, Aklilu Abera (59187806700)', 'Abate, Biruk Beletew (57219674489)', 'Azmeraw, Molla (57216974243)', 'Wondie, Wubet Tazeb (58626209700)', 'Alamaw, Addis Wondmagegn (57214600018)', 'Ngusie, Habtamu Setegn (57226808565)']|['https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8195-3011', 'https://orcid.org/0009-0003-1685-983X', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0833-2504', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9902-7921', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1522-7905', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4927-7556', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4666-1114']|['Children', 'Ethiopia', 'Machine Learning Algorithm', 'Micronutrient Supplementation', 'Prediction']|['Desconocido']|['children', 'ethiopia', 'machine learning algorithm', 'micronutrient supplementation']|Employing advanced supervised machine learning approaches for predicting micronutrient intake status among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia.

However, identifying potent AMPs through laborious experimental assays is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address these limitations, this study presents a bioinformatics approach utilizing machine learning models for predicting and selecting AMPs active against plant pathogenic bacteria. Methods: N-gram representations of peptide sequences with 3-letter and 9-letter reduced amino acid alphabets were used to capture the sequence patterns and motifs that contribute to the antimicrobial activity of AMPs. A 5-fold cross-validation technique was used to train the machine learning models and to evaluate their predictive accuracy and robustness. Results: The models were applied to predict putative AMPs encoded by intergenic regions and small open reading frames (ORFs) of the citrus genome. Approximately 7% of the 10,000-peptide dataset from the intergenic region and 7% of the 685,924-peptide dataset from the whole genome were predicted as probable AMPs. The prediction accuracy of the reported models range from 0.72 to 0.91. A subset of the predicted AMPs was selected for experimental test against Spiroplasma citri, the causative agent of citrus stubborn disease. The experimental results confirm the antimicrobial activity of the selected AMPs against the target bacterium, demonstrating the predictive capability of the machine learning models. Discussion: Hydrophobic amino acid residues and positively charged amino acid residues are among the key features in predicting AMPs by the Random Forest Algorithm. Aggregation propensity appears to be correlated with the effectiveness of the AMPs. The described models would contribute to the development of effective AMP-based strategies for plant disease management in agricultural and environmental settings.

Introduction: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics for combating plant pathogenic bacteria in agriculture and the environment. However, identifying potent AMPs through laborious experimental assays is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address these limitations, this study presents a bioinformatics approach utilizing machine learning models for predicting and selecting AMPs active against plant pathogenic bacteria. Methods: N-gram representations of peptide sequences with 3-letter and 9-letter reduced amino acid alphabets were used to capture the sequence patterns and motifs that contribute to the antimicrobial activity of AMPs. A 5-fold cross-validation technique was used to train the machine learning models and to evaluate their predictive accuracy and robustness. Results: The models were applied to predict putative AMPs encoded by intergenic regions and small open reading frames (ORFs) of the citrus genome. Approximately 7% of the 10,000-peptide dataset from the intergenic region and 7% of the 685,924-peptide dataset from the whole genome were predicted as probable AMPs. The prediction accuracy of the reported models range from 0.72 to 0.91. A subset of the predicted AMPs was selected for experimental test against Spiroplasma citri, the causative agent of citrus stubborn disease. The experimental results confirm the antimicrobial activity of the selected AMPs against the target bacterium, demonstrating the predictive capability of the machine learning models. Discussion: Hydrophobic amino acid residues and positively charged amino acid residues are among the key features in predicting AMPs by the Random Forest Algorithm. Aggregation propensity appears to be correlated with the effectiveness of the AMPs. The described models would contribute to the development of effective AMP-based strategies for plant disease management in agricultural and environmental settings.

Therefore, identification of the genes governing the root traits is an essential research component. With regard to the identification of root-associated genes/proteins, the existing wet-lab experiments are resource intensive and the gene expression studies are species-specific. Thus, we proposed a supervised learning-based computational method for the identification of root-associated proteins. Methods: The problem was formulated as a binary classification, where the root-associated proteins and non-root-associated proteins constituted the two classes. Four different machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and adaptive boosting were employed for the classification of proteins of the two classes. Sequence-derived features such as AAC, DPC, CTD, PAAC, and ACF were used as input for the learning algorithms. Results: The SVM achieved higher accuracy with the 250 selected features of AAC+DPC+CTD than that of other possible combinations of feature sets and learning algorithms. Specifically, SVM with the selected features achieved overall accuracies of 0.74, 0.73, and 0.73 when evaluated with single 5-fold cross-validation (5F-CV), repeated 5F-CV, and independent test set, respectively. Conclusions: A web-enabled prediction tool SVM-Root (https://iasri-sg.icar.gov.in/svmroot/) has been developed for the computational prediction of the root-associated proteins. Being the first of its kind, the proposed model is believed to supplement the existing experimental methods and high throughput GWAS and transcriptome studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights

However, potato plants may suffer from diseases such as early blight, late blight, septoria leaf spot or skin diseases such as greening, silver scurf, common scab, black rot etc. These diseases may lead to huge losses in the potato yield annually. Hence, an early prediction of such diseases is required so that they can be controlled at an early stage. Several machine learning, IoT based and image processing techniques have been utilized for this purpose, and this paper aims to survey all such methods and prediction models. A total of 116 studies were analyzed, and out of them, 77 relevant studies belonging to (60%) journals, (34%) conferences and (6%) other sources have been surveyed. It has been observed that most of the selected studies (64%) have used RGB image data (proprietary or PlantVillage dataset). Also, majority of the studies (48%) have worked with imbalanced data.

In our efforts to uncover the metabolic pathways that contribute to the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves by Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000), we created iPst19, an ensemble of 100 genome-scale network reconstructions of Pst DC3000 metabolism. We developed a novel approach for gene essentiality screens, leveraging the predictive power of iPst19 to identify core and ancillary condition-specific essential genes. Constraining the metabolic flux of iPst19 with Pst DC3000 gene expression data obtained from naïve-infected or pre-immunized-infected plants, revealed changes in bacterial metabolism imposed by plant immunity. Machine learning analysis revealed that among other amino acids, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism significantly contributed to the overall metabolic status of each gene-expression-contextualized iPst19 simulation. These predictions were tested and confirmed experimentally. Pst DC3000 growth and gene expression analysis showed that BCAAs suppress virulence gene expression in vitro without affecting bacterial growth. In planta, however, an excess of BCAAs suppress the expression of virulence genes at the early stages of infection and significantly impair the colonization of Arabidopsis leaves. Our findings suggesting that BCAAs catabolism is necessary to express virulence and colonize the host. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into how plant immunity impacts Pst DC3000 metabolism, and how bacterial metabolism impacts the expression of virulence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Amino Acid; Isoleucine; Jasmonic Acid; Amino Acids, Branched-chain; Amino Acids; Bacteria; Gene Expression; Plants (botany); Arabidopsis Leaves; Bacterial Metabolism; Bacterial Pathogens; Branched Chain Amino Acids; Colonisation; Computational Modelling; Genes Expression; Plant Immunities; Pseudomonas Syringae; Virulence Gene; Metabolism; Amino Acid; Branched Chain Amino Acid; Isoleucine; Jasmonic Acid; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Article; Bacterial Colonization; Bacterial Growth; Bacterial Metabolism; Bacterial Virulence; Biomass Production; Carbon Source; Catabolism; Computer Model; Controlled Study; Dna Extraction; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; In Vitro Study; Machine Learning; Metabolic Flux Analysis; Metabolism; Metabolite; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Plant Defense; Plant Growth; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaf; Plant Virus; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; Pseudomonas Putida; Pseudomonas Syringae Pv.

In this study, we describe a framework for spatial prediction based on RF modelling where inverse distance weighted (IDW) predictors are used in conjunction with ancillary environmental covariates.

As an alternative, this work proposes the use of portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry and machine learning algorithms for rapid and low-cost estimation of macro and micronutrient contents in mineral and organic fertilizers. Four machine learning algorithms were tested. Whole (i.e., as delivered by the manufacturer) (CP) and ground (AQ) samples (429 in total) were analyzed to test the effect of fertilizer granulometry in prediction performance. Model validation indicated highly accurate predictions of macro (N: R2 = 0.92; P: 0.97; K: 0.99; Ca: 0.94, Mg: 0.98; S: 0.96) and micronutrients (B: 0.99; Cu: 0.99; Fe: 0.98; Mn: 0.91; Zn: 0.94) for both organic and mineral fertilizers. RPD values ranged from 2.31 to 9.23 for AQ samples, and Random Forest and Cubist Regression were the algorithms with the best performances. Even samples analyzed as they were received from the manufacturer (i.e., no grinding) provided accurate predictions, which accelerate the confirmation of nutrient contents contained in fertilizers. Results demonstrated the potential of pXRF data coupled with machine learning algorithms to assess nutrient composition in both mineral and organic fertilizers with high accuracy, allowing for clean, fast and accurate quality control. Sensor-driven quality assessment of fertilizers improves soil and plant health, crop management efficiency and food security with a reduced environmental footprint. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights

However, diseases caused by agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and phytoplasmas cause considerable economic damage to these crops. Existing methods for cassava disease detection require farmers to seek the assistance of agricultural experts for visual inspection and diagnosis, which is challenging and laborious. Most studies have employed pre-trained convolutional neural networks to detect diseases in cassava leaves. Also, it is essential to design customized deep neural networks specific to the target domain for precise classification. This research proposes a novel deep fusion of two networks, residual channel shuffled attention network and Efficientnet. The first network, RCSANet, was presented to capture contextual information using depthwise separable convolution effectively.

Cassava is a significant source of carbohydrates for tropical populations. However, diseases caused by agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and phytoplasmas cause considerable economic damage to these crops. Existing methods for cassava disease detection require farmers to seek the assistance of agricultural experts for visual inspection and diagnosis, which is challenging and laborious. Most studies have employed pre-trained convolutional neural networks to detect diseases in cassava leaves. Also, it is essential to design customized deep neural networks specific to the target domain for precise classification. This research proposes a novel deep fusion of two networks, residual channel shuffled attention network and Efficientnet. The first network, RCSANet, was presented to capture contextual information using depthwise separable convolution effectively. It also integrates significant inter-spatial and inter-channel information using the triplet attention module and employs shuffled group convolution to capture features from distinct filter groups. As a result of incorporating the above architectural enhancements, the proposed feature fusion network exhibited better performance than the existing studies.

The objective of this research was to predict the spatial distribution of soil micronutrients within the piedmont plain in northeastern Iran using random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms. Sixty-eight locations with different land uses were sampled to determine the content of iron, manganese, zinc and copper in the topsoil (0–20 cm). Forty-one digital covariates were used as input to the models and were derived from a digital elevation model, open-source remote sensing (RS) data (Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A MSI images), WorldClim climate database and maps of soil properties. Covariates were grouped into 11 scenarios: I–III, based on RS data; IV–VI, including RS, topographic, climate and soil covariates; VII, VIII and IX, based only on topographic, climate and soil covariates, respectively; X and XI, based on recursive feature elimination and expert opinion, respectively. The RF algorithm gave 91, 94, 91 and 108% normalized root mean squared error values for iron, manganese, zinc and copper, respectively, for the validation dataset with scenario XI. The most important digital covariates for micronutrients prediction with both RF and SVR models were precipitation seasonality, mean annual temperature and the mean saturation index based on Sentinel 2A MSI data.

Previous studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have shown the critical roles of the CAM-BINDING PROTEIN 60 (CBP60) protein family in plant growth, stress responses, and immunity. Certain CBP60 factors can regulate plant immune responses, like pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity, and synthesis of major plant immune-activating metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). Although homologous CBP60 sequences have been identified in the plant kingdom, their function and regulation in most species remain unclear. In this paper, we specifically characterized 11 members of the CBP60 family in the agriculturally important crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Protein sequence analyses revealed that three CBP60 homologs have the closest amino acid identity to Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1, master transcription factors involved in plant immunity. Strikingly, AlphaFold deep learning–assisted prediction of protein structures highlighted close structural similarity between these tomato and Arabidopsis CBP60 homologs. Conserved domain analyses revealed that they possess CAM-binding domains and DNA-binding domains, reflecting their potential involvement in linking Ca2+ signaling and transcriptional regulation in tomato plants. In terms of their gene expression profiles under biotic (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 pathogen infection) and/or abiotic stress (warming temperatures), five tomato CBP60 genes were pathogen-responsive and temperature-sensitive, reminiscent of Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1. Overall, we present a genome-wide identification of the CBP60 gene/protein family in tomato plants, and we provide evidence on their regulation and potential function as Ca2+-sensing transcriptional regulators. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Alphafold; Climate Change; Gene Expression; Gene Regulation; Plant Defense; Plant Immunity; Pseudomonas Syringae; Salicylic Acid; Temperature; Tomato; Transcription Factor; Calcium; Salicylic Acid; Arabidopsis Proteins; Calcium; Calmodulin; Calmodulin-binding Proteins; Salicylic Acid; Transcription Factors; Calmodulin Binding Protein; Calmodulin Binding Protein 60; Unclassified Drug; Arabidopsis Protein; Calcium; Calmodulin; Salicylic Acid; Transcription Factor; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Article; Calcium Signaling; Cbp60 Gene; Controlled Study; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Identification; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Plant Gene; Plant Growth; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaf; Plant Structures; Pseudomonas Syringae Pv.

In agriculture, plant diseases are mainly responsible for production degradation, which causes economic loss. In plants, citrus is widely utilized as a critical resource of nutrients such as vitamin C. But Citrus disease negatively impacts the quality and production of citrus fruits. Over the last few years, image processing and computer vision technologies have been extensively applied to detect and classify diseases in plants. Mostly, plant disease has clear signs, and today's recognized model is for an expert plant diagnostician to recognize the disease by observing a diseased plant leaf through a microscope. Manual disease detection can be labour-intensive and the efficiency of the diagnoses is associated with the pathologist's skills, which makes this a greater application field for computer-aided diagnosis systems. This work develops an effectual Duck Optimization with Enhanced Capsule Network Based Citrus Disease Detection for Sustainable Crop Management (DOECN-CDDCM) technique. The presented technique majorly focuses on the detection and classification of citrus diseases. In the presented approach, several stages of preprocessing are performed. In addition, the duck optimization algorithm (DOA) with the Enhanced Capsule Network (ECN) model is exploited as a feature extractor, and the optimal hyperparameter tuning process helps obtain enhanced performance.

Sustainable agriculture methodology seeks to apply natural resources whereby they could reconstruct their productive capacity and minimise adverse effects on the ecosystem beyond a field edge. In agriculture, plant diseases are mainly responsible for production degradation, which causes economic loss. In plants, citrus is widely utilized as a critical resource of nutrients such as vitamin C. But Citrus disease negatively impacts the quality and production of citrus fruits. Over the last few years, image processing and computer vision technologies have been extensively applied to detect and classify diseases in plants. Mostly, plant disease has clear signs, and today's recognized model is for an expert plant diagnostician to recognize the disease by observing a diseased plant leaf through a microscope. Manual disease detection can be labour-intensive and the efficiency of the diagnoses is associated with the pathologist's skills, which makes this a greater application field for computer-aided diagnosis systems. This work develops an effectual Duck Optimization with Enhanced Capsule Network Based Citrus Disease Detection for Sustainable Crop Management (DOECN-CDDCM) technique. The presented technique majorly focuses on the detection and classification of citrus diseases. In the presented approach, several stages of preprocessing are performed. In addition, the duck optimization algorithm (DOA) with the Enhanced Capsule Network (ECN) model is exploited as a feature extractor, and the optimal hyperparameter tuning process helps obtain enhanced performance. Finally, the deep stacked sparse autoencoder (DSSAE) model is utilized for citrus disease detection and classification. A series of simulations were performed to ensure the enhanced disease detection performance of the DOECN-CDDCM algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate the improvised outcomes of the DOECN-CDDCM algorithm than other current techniques. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|1|0.92952585|Tópico 2: tomato, fruit, grape

It is important to predict mineral content in contaminated rice rapidly. In this study, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied to quantify minerals (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, and Na) in rice leaves under chromium (Cr) stress. Two feature extraction methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were compared to identify important variables that related to mineral concentrations. Results showed that partial least square regression (PLSR) achieved good performance in Ca, Fe Mg, K, Mn, and Na, with correlation coefficient of 0.9782, 0.8712, 0.8933, 0.9206, 0.9856, and 0.9865, root mean square error of 219.25, 14.78, 1192.47, 385.12, 9.56, and 124.32 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, the correlation between different spectral lines were further analyzed. Cr exhibited a positive correlation with Ca, Mg, and Na, and a negative correlation with Mn, Cu, and K.

At present, it is difficult to diagnose rice fungal diseases at an early stage using relevant technologies, and there are a lack of rapid detection methods. This study proposes a microfluidic chip-based method combined with microscopic hyperspectral detection of rice fungal disease spores. First, a microfluidic chip with a dual inlet and three-stage structure was designed to separate and enrich Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores in air. Then, the microscopic hyperspectral instrument was used to collect the hyperspectral data of the fungal disease spores in the enrichment area, and the competitive adaptive reweighting algorithm (CARS) was used to screen the characteristic bands of the spectral data collected from the spores of the two fungal diseases. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to build the full-band classification model and the CARS filtered characteristic wavelength classification model, respectively. The results showed that the actual enrichment efficiency of the microfluidic chip designed in this study on Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores was 82.67% and 80.70%, respectively. In the established model, the CARS-CNN classification model is the best for the classification of Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores, and its F1-core index can reach 0.960 and 0.949, respectively. This study can effectively isolate and enrich Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores, providing new methods and ideas for early detection of rice fungal disease spores. © 2023

As rice is one of the world’s most important food crops, protecting it from fungal diseases is very important for agricultural production. At present, it is difficult to diagnose rice fungal diseases at an early stage using relevant technologies, and there are a lack of rapid detection methods. This study proposes a microfluidic chip-based method combined with microscopic hyperspectral detection of rice fungal disease spores. First, a microfluidic chip with a dual inlet and three-stage structure was designed to separate and enrich Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores in air. Then, the microscopic hyperspectral instrument was used to collect the hyperspectral data of the fungal disease spores in the enrichment area, and the competitive adaptive reweighting algorithm (CARS) was used to screen the characteristic bands of the spectral data collected from the spores of the two fungal diseases. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to build the full-band classification model and the CARS filtered characteristic wavelength classification model, respectively. The results showed that the actual enrichment efficiency of the microfluidic chip designed in this study on Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores was 82.67% and 80.70%, respectively. In the established model, the CARS-CNN classification model is the best for the classification of Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores, and its F1-core index can reach 0.960 and 0.949, respectively. This study can effectively isolate and enrich Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores, providing new methods and ideas for early detection of rice fungal disease spores. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|0|0.42679557|Tópico 1: cassava, blight, potato

Its early detection is crucial for suppressing disease spread. Necrotic lesions are normally seen in leaves at 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) when colonized cells are dead, but early detection of the initial biotrophic growth stage, when the pathogen feeds on living cells, is challenging. Here, the biotrophic growth phase of P. infestans was detected by whole-plant redox imaging of potato plants expressing chloroplast-targeted reduction–oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (chl-roGFP2). Clear spots on potato leaves with a lower chl-roGFP2 oxidation state were detected as early as 2 dpi, before any visual symptoms were recorded. These spots were particularly evident during light-to-dark transitions, and reflected the mislocalization of chl-roGFP2 outside the chloroplasts. Image analysis based on machine learning enabled systematic identification and quantification of spots, and unbiased classification of infected and uninfected leaves in inoculated plants. Comparing redox with chlorophyll fluorescence imaging showed that infected leaf areas that exhibit mislocalized chl-roGFP2 also showed reduced non-photochemical quenching and enhanced quantum PSII yield (ΦPSII) compared with the surrounding leaf areas. The data suggest that mislocalization of chloroplast-targeted proteins is an efficient marker of late blight infection, and demonstrate how it can be utilized for non-destructive monitoring of the disease biotrophic stage using whole-plant redox imaging. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Chloroplast; Late Blight; Phytophthora Infestans; Potato; Redox Imaging; Rogfp2; Technical Advance; Plants (botany); Proteins; Cell/b.e; Chloroplast; Late Blight; Phytophthora Infestans; Post Inoculation; Potato; Redox Imaging; Rogfp2; Technical Advances; Whole Plants; Fluorescence Imaging; Cells; Classification; Detection; Growth; Inoculation; Leaves; Plants; Plant Disease; Potato; Plant Diseases; Solanum Tuberosum|Plants (botany); Proteins; Cell/B.E; Chloroplast; Late blight; Phytophthora infestans; Post inoculation; Potato; Redox imaging; Rogfp2; Technical advances; Whole plants; Fluorescence imaging; Cells; Classification; Detection; Growth; Inoculation; Leaves; Plants; plant disease; potato; Plant Diseases; Solanum tuberosum|Article|Final|All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access|Scopus|2-s2.0-85147225654|5; 15; 9; 2; 47; 30; 23|378.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8632-8845; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9275-5560; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4443-1940; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0571-8161; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8565-9979|early detection late blight potato wholeplant redox imaging|late blight caused oomycete phytophthora infestans devastating disease potatoes solanum tuberosum early detection crucial suppressing disease spread necrotic lesions normally seen leaves days postinoculation dpi colonized cells dead early detection initial biotrophic growth stage pathogen feeds living cells challenging biotrophic growth phase p infestans detected wholeplant redox imaging potato plants expressing chloroplasttargeted reductionoxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein chlrogfp clear spots potato leaves lower chlrogfp oxidation state detected early dpi visual symptoms recorded spots particularly evident lighttodark transitions reflected mislocalization chlrogfp outside chloroplasts image analysis based machine learning enabled systematic identification quantification spots unbiased classification infected uninfected leaves inoculated plants comparing redox chlorophyll fluorescence imaging showed infected leaf areas exhibit mislocalized chlrogfp also showed reduced nonphotochemical quenching enhanced quantum psii yield φpsii compared surrounding leaf areas data suggest mislocalization chloroplasttargeted proteins efficient marker late blight infection demonstrate utilized nondestructive monitoring disease biotrophic stage using wholeplant redox imaging elsevier bv rights reserved|chloroplast late blight phytophthora infestans potato redox imaging rogfp technical advance plants botany proteins cellbe chloroplast late blight phytophthora infestans post inoculation potato redox imaging rogfp technical advances whole plants fluorescence imaging cells classification detection growth inoculation leaves plants plant disease potato plant diseases solanum tuberosum|plants botany proteins cellbe chloroplast late blight phytophthora infestans post inoculation potato redox imaging rogfp technical advances whole plants fluorescence imaging cells classification detection growth inoculation leaves plants plant disease potato plant diseases solanum tuberosum|['M., Hipsch, Matanel', 'Y., Michael, Yaron', 'N., Lampl, Nardy', 'O., Sapir, Omer', 'Y.R., Cohen, Yigal R.', 'D., Helman, David', 'S., Rosenwasser, Shilo']|['Hipsch, Matanel (57221468995)', 'Michael, Yaron (56461039900)', 'Lampl, Nardy (35956406400)', 'Sapir, Omer (57952488900)', 'Cohen, Yigal R.

Lime plant is one of the major crop in the field of agriculture that provides vitamin and it is grown in more than 30 countries. Various research clarifies that by consuming lime provides greater immunity. Plant disease is the greatest adversity that provides loss during the time of yield. Detection of the plant disease is very important in order to prevent the yield losses. Lime plants also getting affected by various types of diseases and one of them is canker. The dataset used in this work are the images that are affected by the canker disease in different stages.

Effective implementation of programs aimed at reducing MN deficiencies requires an understanding of the important drivers of suboptimal MN intake. Therefore, this study aimed to identify important predictors of MN deficiency among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia using machine learning algorithms. Methods: This study employed data from the 2019 Ethiopia Mini Demographic and Health Survey (2019 EMDHS) and included a sample of 1,455 children aged 6–23 months for analysis. Machine Learning (ML) methods including, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Naïve Bayes (NB) were used to prioritize risk factors for MN deficiency prediction. Performance metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves were used to evaluate model prediction performance. Results: The prediction performance of the RF model was the best performing ML model in predicting child MN deficiency, with an AUROC of 80.01% and accuracy of 72.41% in the test data.

Introduction: Micronutrient (MN) deficiencies are a major public health problem in developing countries including Ethiopia, leading to childhood morbidity and mortality. Effective implementation of programs aimed at reducing MN deficiencies requires an understanding of the important drivers of suboptimal MN intake. Therefore, this study aimed to identify important predictors of MN deficiency among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia using machine learning algorithms. Methods: This study employed data from the 2019 Ethiopia Mini Demographic and Health Survey (2019 EMDHS) and included a sample of 1,455 children aged 6–23 months for analysis. Machine Learning (ML) methods including, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Naïve Bayes (NB) were used to prioritize risk factors for MN deficiency prediction. Performance metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves were used to evaluate model prediction performance. Results: The prediction performance of the RF model was the best performing ML model in predicting child MN deficiency, with an AUROC of 80.01% and accuracy of 72.41% in the test data. The RF algorithm identified the eastern region of Ethiopia, poorest wealth index, no maternal education, lack of media exposure, home delivery, and younger child age as the top prioritized risk factors in their order of importance for MN deficiency prediction. Conclusion: The RF algorithm outperformed other ML algorithms in predicting child MN deficiency in Ethiopia. Based on the findings of this study, improving women’s education, increasing exposure to mass media, introducing MN-rich foods in early childhood, enhancing access to health services, and targeted intervention in the eastern region are strongly recommended to significantly reduce child MN deficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|6|0.5343393|Tópico 7: model, data, study

More over 60% of the world’s population relies mostly on agricultural sources for food, according to linked statistics. Plant infections, however, are a catastrophic issue that seriously hampers agriculture productivity. Plant diseases cause a loss of agriculture productivity of about 25% per year. Potato crops have many benefits for human life. One of the most valuable benefits of potatoes for humans is their carbohydrate content; carbohydrates are the leading food for humans. The development of potato crop agriculture is significant for the sustainability of human life. There are several obstacles to developing potato farming, including a disease that attacks potato leaves. Infestans only the diseases early Blight (Alternia Solani) and late Blight (Phytophthora infestans de Bary) are among the most harmful to potato crops. However, the percentage of crops that fail to grow grows due to the erroneous and tardy identification of plant diseases. Using a diagnostic and detection system based on the Hybrid CNN (Convolutional neural network) with SVM (Support vector machine) presently deep learning (DL) technology, we offer an efficient and accurate way to identify early plant illnesses to reduce the plant output losses. Potato leaf disease detection issues can be resolved with the use of informatics technology and digital image processing. From the input photos of the supported training dataset, we utilised CNN to extract best feature of the illness characteristics, and then we used SVM to those features to do classification. 1900 photos of potato leaves were used to train the deep learning model, and about 950 images were utilised for testing. We suggested the CNN model and trained a strong accuracy data set. In addition, we employed ResNET50, a transfer learning model, and obtained accuracy that was superior to our suggested CNN model. It’s interesting that the accuracy of our suggested Hybrid CNN (ResNet 50) with SVN is 97.3% and that it was trained using the same Potato lead picture dataset and test data accuracy is 95.6. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Cnn;

Over the past few years, there has been a significant growth in the application of machine learning and computer vision techniques, in early detection and classification of plant disorders. This study, proposes a deep learning-based approach for detecting nutritional deficiencies in guava leaf images. A dataset of guava leaf images captured using mobile devices, containing various nutritional deficiencies including magnesium and phosphorous, was acquired for training the model. A pre-trained deep CNN model is employed to extract convolved features and detect the affected regions, categorizing them as nutritional deficient or non-nutritional deficient Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 87% in detecting nutritional deficiencies in guava leaf images. These outcomes demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a reliable and accurate method for early detection of nutritional deficiencies in guava leaves.

This study, proposes a deep learning-based approach for detecting nutritional deficiencies in guava leaf images. A dataset of guava leaf images captured using mobile devices, containing various nutritional deficiencies including magnesium and phosphorous, was acquired for training the model. A pre-trained deep CNN model is employed to extract convolved features and detect the affected regions, categorizing them as nutritional deficient or non-nutritional deficient Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 87% in detecting nutritional deficiencies in guava leaf images. These outcomes demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a reliable and accurate method for early detection of nutritional deficiencies in guava leaves. This approach has the potential to be deployed in the agricultural domain for the effective diagnosis of plant nutrient deficiencies, ultimately increasing crop productivity and nutritional quality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|4|0.4911169|Tópico 5: crop, soil, system

Early identification and disease diagnosis of fruit crops are essential for the food industry to increase production. The development of the healthy fruit sector is highly dependent on plant diseases. Guava fruit is a good source of fiber, calcium, pectins, and vitamin C. Guava disease has become a major issue for guava production, which has a negative impact on farmers' socioeconomic growth. Infections that harm guava plants and fruits pose the greatest obstacles, although they can be avoided by early identification. Deep learning has recently been widely used to automatically identify a variety of diseases that cannot be seen with the human eye. In this study, convolution neural models are suggested to use leaf images to detect guava disease. The presented models can be used to categorize the main guava leaf diseases, including Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. The kaggle dataset is used to gather images of guava with the disease Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. In our work, CNN models like DenseNet121, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, and Xception are used to categorize the diseases that affect guava leaves. The experimental findings indicate that, with an accuracy of 96.12%, the DenseNet169 model outperformed other models. When the model's effectiveness is assessed using performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, the results demonstrate that DenseNet169 gives excellent results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Guava Leave Disease; Plant Leave Disease; Pretrained Models; Transfer Learning; Convolution; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Economics; Fruits; Learning Systems; Plants (botany); Comparatives Studies; Convolutional Neural Network; Guava Leave Disease; Learning Models; Plant Disease; Plant Leave Disease; Plant Leaves; Pretrained Model; Transfer Learning; Convolutional Neural Networks|Convolution; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Economics; Fruits; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Comparatives studies; Convolutional neural network; Guava leave disease; Learning models; Plant disease; Plant leave disease; Plant leaves; Pretrained model; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural networks|Conference paper|Final||Scopus|2-s2.0-85160447223|7; 3; 15; 1; 7; 1|||https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0874-7638; https://orcid.org/0009-0007-8705-4181; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7736-7885|comparative study deep learning models guava leaf disease detection|plant diseases regarded one major variables affecting food production reducing production losses early identification disease diagnosis fruit crops essential food industry increase production development healthy fruit sector highly dependent plant diseases guava fruit good source fiber calcium pectins vitamin c guava disease become major issue guava production negative impact farmers socioeconomic growth infections harm guava plants fruits pose greatest obstacles although avoided early identification deep learning recently widely used automatically identify variety diseases cannot seen human eye study convolution neural models suggested use leaf images detect guava disease presented models used categorize main guava leaf diseases including canker dot healthy mummification rust kaggle dataset used gather images guava disease canker dot healthy mummification rust work cnn models like densenet densenet inceptionv xception used categorize diseases affect guava leaves experimental findings indicate accuracy densenet model outperformed models models effectiveness assessed using performance metrics like precision recall f score results demonstrate densenet gives excellent results elsevier bv rights reserved|convolutional neural network deep learning guava leave disease plant leave disease pretrained models transfer learning convolution deep learning diagnosis economics fruits learning systems plants botany comparatives studies convolutional neural network guava leave disease learning models plant disease plant leave disease plant leaves pretrained model transfer learning convolutional neural networks|convolution deep learning diagnosis economics fruits learning systems plants botany comparatives studies convolutional neural network guava leave disease learning models plant disease plant leave disease plant leaves pretrained model transfer learning convolutional neural networks|['R., Thangaraj, R.', 'M.R., Mohan, M.

The development of the healthy fruit sector is highly dependent on plant diseases. Guava fruit is a good source of fiber, calcium, pectins, and vitamin C. Guava disease has become a major issue for guava production, which has a negative impact on farmers' socioeconomic growth. Infections that harm guava plants and fruits pose the greatest obstacles, although they can be avoided by early identification. Deep learning has recently been widely used to automatically identify a variety of diseases that cannot be seen with the human eye. In this study, convolution neural models are suggested to use leaf images to detect guava disease. The presented models can be used to categorize the main guava leaf diseases, including Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. The kaggle dataset is used to gather images of guava with the disease Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. In our work, CNN models like DenseNet121, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, and Xception are used to categorize the diseases that affect guava leaves. The experimental findings indicate that, with an accuracy of 96.12%, the DenseNet169 model outperformed other models. When the model's effectiveness is assessed using performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, the results demonstrate that DenseNet169 gives excellent results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|6|0.70374733|Tópico 7: model, data, study

Soil testing is an effective tool for evaluating soil nutrient levels and calculating the appropriate quantitative of soil nutrients based on fertility and crop requirements. Because traditional soil nutrient testing models are impractical for real-time applications, efficient soil nutrient and potential hydrogen (pH) prediction models are required to improve overall crop productivity. Soil testing is an effective method to evaluate the presence of nutrient status of soil and assists in determining appropriate nutrient quantity. Methods: Various machine learning (ML) models proposed, predict the soil nutrients, soil type, and soil moisture. To assess the significant soil nutrient content, this study develops an enhanced reptile search optimization with convolutional autoencoder (ERSOCAE-SNC) model for classifying and predicting the fertility indices. The model majorly focuses on the soil test reports. For classification, CAE model is applied which accurately determines the nutrient levels such as phosphorus (P), available potassium (K), organic carbon (OC), boron (B) and soil pH level. Since the trial-and-error method for hyperparameter tuning of CAE model is a tedious and erroneous process, the ERSO algorithm has been utilized which in turn enhances the classification performance. Besides, the ERSO algorithm is derived by incorporating the chaotic concepts into the RSO algorithm. Results: Finally, the influence of the ERSOCAE-SNC model is examined using a series of simulations. The ERSOCAE-SNC model reported best results over other approaches and produces an accuracy of 98.99% for soil nutrients and 99.12% for soil pH. The model developed for the ML decision systems will help the Tamil Nadu government to manage the problems in soil nutrient deficiency and improve the soil health and environmental quality.

Food labels provide consumers with information regarding the nutritional content of food items and have been identified as a potential tool for improving diets. However, due to governmental regulations and the physical limitations of the labels, food labels often lack comprehensive information about the vitamins and minerals present in foods. As a result, information about most of the micronutrients is absent from existing food labels. Objective: This paper aims to examine the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to predict unreported micronutrients such as vitamin A (retinol), vitamin C, vitamin B1 (thiamin), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), vitamin K, and minerals such as magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, selenium, manganese, and copper from nutrition information provided on existing food labels. If unreported micronutrients can be predicted with acceptable accuracies from existing food labels using machine learning predictive models, such models can be integrated into mobile apps to provide consumers with additional micronutrient information about foods and help them make more informed diet decisions. Methods: Data from the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) data set, representing a total of 5624 foods, were used to train a diverse set of machine learning classification and regression algorithms to predict unreported vitamins and minerals from existing food label data. For each model, hyperparameters were adjusted, and the models were evaluated using repeated cross-validation to ensure that the reported results were not subject to overfitting. Results: According to the results, while predicting the exact quantity of vitamins and minerals is shown to be challenging, with regression R2 varying in a wide range from 0.28 (for magnesium) to 0.92 (for manganese), the classification models can accurately predict the category (“low,” “medium,” or “high”) level of all minerals and vitamins with accuracies exceeding 0.80. The highest classification accuracies for specific micronutrients are achieved for vitamin B12 (0.94) and phosphorus (0.94), while the lowest are for vitamin E (0.81) and selenium (0.83). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting unreported micronutrients from existing food labels using machine learning algorithms. The results show that the approach has the potential to significantly improve consumer knowledge about the micronutrient content of the foods they consume. Integrating these predictive models into mobile apps can enhance their accessibility and engagement with consumers. The implications of this research for public health are noteworthy, underscoring the potential of technology to augment consumers’ understanding of the micronutrient content of their diets while also facilitating the tracking of food intake and providing personalized recommendations based on the micronutrient content and individual preferences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Algorithm;

Background: Micronutrient deficiencies represent a major global health issue, with over 2 billion individuals experiencing deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals. Food labels provide consumers with information regarding the nutritional content of food items and have been identified as a potential tool for improving diets. However, due to governmental regulations and the physical limitations of the labels, food labels often lack comprehensive information about the vitamins and minerals present in foods. As a result, information about most of the micronutrients is absent from existing food labels. Objective: This paper aims to examine the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to predict unreported micronutrients such as vitamin A (retinol), vitamin C, vitamin B1 (thiamin), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), vitamin K, and minerals such as magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, selenium, manganese, and copper from nutrition information provided on existing food labels. If unreported micronutrients can be predicted with acceptable accuracies from existing food labels using machine learning predictive models, such models can be integrated into mobile apps to provide consumers with additional micronutrient information about foods and help them make more informed diet decisions. Methods: Data from the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) data set, representing a total of 5624 foods, were used to train a diverse set of machine learning classification and regression algorithms to predict unreported vitamins and minerals from existing food label data. For each model, hyperparameters were adjusted, and the models were evaluated using repeated cross-validation to ensure that the reported results were not subject to overfitting. Results: According to the results, while predicting the exact quantity of vitamins and minerals is shown to be challenging, with regression R2 varying in a wide range from 0.28 (for magnesium) to 0.92 (for manganese), the classification models can accurately predict the category (“low,” “medium,” or “high”) level of all minerals and vitamins with accuracies exceeding 0.80. The highest classification accuracies for specific micronutrients are achieved for vitamin B12 (0.94) and phosphorus (0.94), while the lowest are for vitamin E (0.81) and selenium (0.83). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting unreported micronutrients from existing food labels using machine learning algorithms. The results show that the approach has the potential to significantly improve consumer knowledge about the micronutrient content of the foods they consume. Integrating these predictive models into mobile apps can enhance their accessibility and engagement with consumers. The implications of this research for public health are noteworthy, underscoring the potential of technology to augment consumers’ understanding of the micronutrient content of their diets while also facilitating the tracking of food intake and providing personalized recommendations based on the micronutrient content and individual preferences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|6|0.5302887|Tópico 7: model, data, study

Infected plants have an impact on the agricultural production and economic resources of a country. Early detection of plant diseases minimizes the risk of crop loss by allowing farmers to adopt curative and preventative actions to avoid further damage. Citrus is a large plant that is primarily grown in tropical areas of the world because of its high vitamin C and other key nutrient content. Citrus plant diseases play a vital role in causing a great financial loss to the farmers and affect the economy of the country. The tomato ranks among the most economically important vegetable crops, with a global production rate of around 200 million tonnes. But due to diseases occurring in the tomato plants, the farmers are facing a great loss. To prevent these losses and provide an immediate cure, we create a model to detect plant diseases. To get a better performance model, the data augmentation process is used, and we got 18,392 images. In our model, we used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the citrus and tomato leaf diseases. The diseases are Mancha Graxa, Citrus Canker, Tomato Early Blight, Tomato Septoria Leafspot, Tomato Spider Mite Two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), Tomato mosaic virus (Tobamovirus), Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (Begomovirus), Tomato Target Spot (Corynespora cassiicola). Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is stacked by multiple convolutions and pooling layers to detect plant leaf diseases. We train a model with augmented images. After the model gets trained, it is thoroughly tested to ensure that the results are accurate. Thereby we were able to achieve high validation accuracy with a rate of (97.02%) for this dataset used. As the results showed, applying the deep CNN model to identify diseases could greatly impact the accurate identification of diseases, and could even prove useful in detecting diseases in real-time agricultural systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Citrus Disease; Convolutional Neural Network (cnn); Deep Learning; Tomato Diseases; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Damage Detection; Deep Learning; Drought; Fruits; Multilayer Neural Networks; Real Time Systems; Tropics; Viruses; Agricultural Productions; Citrus Disease; Convolutional Neural Network; Economic Resources; Leaf Disease; Plant Disease; Production Resources; Tomato Disease; Losses|Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Damage detection; Deep learning; Drought; Fruits; Multilayer neural networks; Real time systems; Tropics; Viruses; Agricultural productions; Citrus disease; Convolutional neural network; Economic resources; Leaf disease; Plant disease; Production resources; Tomato disease; Losses|Conference paper|Final||Scopus|2-s2.0-85147854226|1; 1; 1; 10; 1; 5; 1|66.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2634-3154; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9284-9383|deep learning based recognition plant diseases|every countrys primary requirement agricultural products infected plants impact agricultural production economic resources country early detection plant diseases minimizes risk crop loss allowing farmers adopt curative preventative actions avoid damage citrus large plant primarily grown tropical areas world high vitamin c key nutrient content citrus plant diseases play vital role causing great financial loss farmers affect economy country tomato ranks among economically important vegetable crops global production rate around million tonnes due diseases occurring tomato plants farmers facing great loss prevent losses provide immediate cure create model detect plant diseases get better performance model data augmentation process used got images model used convolutional neural network cnn classify citrus tomato leaf diseases diseases mancha graxa citrus canker tomato early blight tomato septoria leafspot tomato spider mite twospotted spider mite tetranychus urticae tomato mosaic virus tobamovirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus begomovirus tomato target spot corynespora cassiicola convolution neural network cnn stacked multiple convolutions pooling layers detect plant leaf diseases train model augmented images model gets trained thoroughly tested ensure results accurate thereby able achieve high validation accuracy rate dataset used results showed applying deep cnn model identify diseases could greatly impact accurate identification diseases could even prove useful detecting diseases realtime agricultural systems elsevier bv rights reserved|citrus disease convolutional neural network cnn deep learning tomato diseases convolution convolutional neural networks crops damage detection deep learning drought fruits multilayer neural networks real time systems tropics viruses agricultural productions citrus disease convolutional neural network economic resources leaf disease plant disease production resources tomato disease losses|convolution convolutional neural networks crops damage detection deep learning drought fruits multilayer neural networks real time systems tropics viruses agricultural productions citrus disease convolutional neural network economic resources leaf disease plant disease production resources tomato disease losses|['S., Parthiban, Swetha', 'S., Moorthy, Sneha', 'S., Sabanayagam, Sribalaji', 'S., Shanmugasundaram, Shobana', 'A., Naganathan, Athishwaran', 'M., Annamalai, Mohan', 'B., Sabitha, B.']|['Parthiban, Swetha (58099179400)', 'Moorthy, Sneha (58099179500)', 'Sabanayagam, Sribalaji (58099179600)', 'Shanmugasundaram, Shobana (56145332900)', 'Naganathan, Athishwaran (58099412700)', 'Annamalai, Mohan (58099371100)', 'Sabitha, B.

There is also an urgent need to increase the number of alternative techniques for detecting plant diseases, which is now lacking. The agriculture and agricultural support sectors in India provide employment for the great majority of the country’s people. In India, the agricultural production of the country is directly connected to the country’s economic growth rate. In order to sustain healthy plant development, a variety of processes must be followed, including consideration of environmental factors and water supply management for the optimal production of crops. It is inefficient and uncertain in its outcomes to use the traditional method of watering a lawn. The devastation of more than 18% of the world’s agricultural produce is caused by disease attacks on an annual basis. Because it is difficult to execute these activities manually, identifying plant diseases is essential to decreasing losses in the agricultural product business. In addition to diagnosing a wide range of plant ailments, our method also includes the identification of infections as a prophylactic step. Below is a detailed description of a farm-based module that includes numerous cloud data centers and data conversion devices for accurately monitoring and managing farm information and environmental elements. This procedure involves imaging the plant’s visually obvious signs in order to identify disease. It is recommended that the therapy be used in conjunction with an application to minimize any harm. Increased productivity as a result of the suggested approach would help both the agricultural and irrigation sectors. The plant area module is fitted with a mobile camera that captures images of all of the plants in the area, and all of the plants’ information is saved in a database, which is accessible from any computer with Internet access. It is planned to record information on the plant’s name, the type of illness that has been afflicted, and an image of the plant. In a wide range of applications, bots are used to collect images of various plants as well as to prevent disease transmission. To ensure that all information given is retained on the Internet, data is collected and stored in cloud storage as it becomes essential to regulate the condition. According to our findings from our research on wide images of healthy and ill fruit and plant leaves, real-time diagnosis of plant leaf diseases may be done with 98.78% accuracy in a laboratory environment. We utilized 40,000 photographs and then analyzed 10,000 photos to construct a DCDM deep learning model, which was then used to train additional models on the data set. Using a cloud-based image diagnostic and classification service, consumers may receive information about their condition in less than a second on average, with the process requiring only 0.349 s on average. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Agricultural Product Sector; Cloud Data Center; Cloud Storage; Deeplens Classification And Detection Model (dcdm); Mobile Camera; Plant Diseases;

Facing incidence of different physiological disorders such as callusing, shoot tip necrosis (STN) and vitrification (Vit) in walnut proliferation, it is necessary to develop prediction models for identifying the impact of different factors involving in this process. In the present study, three machine learning (ML) approaches including multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and gene expression programming (GEP) were implemented and compared to multiple linear regression (MLR) to develop models for prediction of in vitro proliferation of Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.). The accuracy of developed models was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). With the aim of optimizing the selected prediction models, multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique was applied. Results: Our results indicated that all three ML techniques had higher accuracy of prediction than MLR, for example, calculated R2 of MLPNN, KNN and GEP vs. MLR was 0.695, 0.672 and 0.802 vs. 0.412 in Chandler and 0.358, 0.377 and 0.428 vs. 0.178 in Rayen, respectively. The GEP models were further selected to be optimized using PSO. The comparison of modeling procedures provides a new insight into in vitro culture medium composition prediction models. Based on the results, hybrid GEP-PSO technique displays good performance for modeling walnut tissue culture media, while MLPNN and KNN have also shown strong estimation capability. Conclusion: Here, besides MLPNN and GEP, KNN also is introduced, for the first time, as a simple technique with high accuracy to be used for developing prediction models in optimizing plant tissue culture media composition studies.

Mango fruit is one of the most popular and desirable fruits worldwide due to its taste and richness in vitamins. However, plant diseases also affect these plants’ production and quality. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based metaheuristic approach for disease diagnosis and detection. The proposed approach involves preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and disease classification. First, the image of mango leaves is enhanced using histogram equalization and contrast enhancement. Then, a geometric mean-based neutrosophic with a fuzzy c-means method is used for segmentation. Next, the essential features are retrieved from the segmented images, including the Upgraded Local Binary Pattern (ULBP), color, and pixel features. Finally, these features are given into the disease detection phase, which is modeled using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (deep learning model). Furthermore, to enhance the classification accuracy of CNN, the weights are fine-tuned using a new hybrid optimization model referred to as Cat Swarm Updated Black Widow Model (CSUBW). The new hybrid optimization model is developed by hybridizing the standard Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSO) and Black Widow Optimization Algorithm (BWO).

This method can solve the problems of noise, background interference, and low detection accuracy of maize leaf disease images. To begin, a processing layer called Wavelet threshold guided bilateral filtering (WT-GBF) based on the WG-MARNet model is employed to reduce image noise and perform high and low-frequency decomposition of the input image using WT-GBF. This increases the input image’s resistance to environmental interference and feature extraction capability. Secondly, for the multiscale feature fusion technique, an average down-sampling and tiling method is employed to increase feature representation and limit the risk of overfitting. Then, on high and low-frequency multi-channel, an attenuation factor is introduced to optimize the performance instability during training of the deep network. Finally, when the convergence and accuracy are compared, PRelu and Adabound are used instead of the Relu activation function and the Adam optimizer. The experimental results revealed that our method’s average recognition accuracy was 97.96%, and the detection time for a single image was 0.278 seconds. The average detection accuracy has been increased.

Accurate prediction of plant phosphorylation sites (p-sites) is vital as abnormal regulation of phosphorylation usually leads to plant diseases. However, current experimental methods for PTM prediction suffers from high-computational cost and are error-prone. The present study develops machine learning-based prediction techniques, including a high-performance interpretable deep tabular learning network (TabNet) to improve the prediction of protein p-sites in soybean. Moreover, we use a hybrid feature set of sequential-based features, physicochemical properties and position-specific scoring matrices to predict serine (Ser/S), threonine (Thr/T) and tyrosine (Tyr/Y) p-sites in soybean for the first time. The experimentally verified p-sites data of soybean proteins are collected from the eukaryotic phosphorylation sites database and database post-translational modification. We then remove the redundant set of positive and negative samples by dropping protein sequences with >40% similarity. It is found that the developed techniques perform >70% in terms of accuracy. The results demonstrate that the TabNet model is the best performing classifier using hybrid features and with window size of 13, resulted in 78.96 and 77.24% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The results indicate that the TabNet method has advantages in terms of high-performance and interpretability. The proposed technique can automatically analyze the data without any measurement errors and any human intervention.

In addition, salinization jeopardizes agroecosystems, inducing salt stress in most cultivated plants (nutrient deficiency, pH and oxidative stress, biomass reduction), and directly affects the quality and quantity of food production. Depending on the type of salt/stress (alkaline or pH-neutral), specific approaches and solutions should be applied to ameliorate the situation on-site.

Salinization of soils and freshwater resources by natural processes and/or human activities has become an increasing issue that affects environmental services and socioeconomic relations. In addition, salinization jeopardizes agroecosystems, inducing salt stress in most cultivated plants (nutrient deficiency, pH and oxidative stress, biomass reduction), and directly affects the quality and quantity of food production. Depending on the type of salt/stress (alkaline or pH-neutral), specific approaches and solutions should be applied to ameliorate the situation on-site. Various agro-hydrotechnical (soil and water conservation, reduced tillage, mulching, rainwater harvesting, irrigation and drainage, control of seawater intrusion), biological (agroforestry, multi-cropping, cultivation of salt-resistant species, bacterial inoculation, promotion of mycorrhiza, grafting with salt-resistant rootstocks), chemical (application of organic and mineral amendments, phytohormones), bio-ecological (breeding, desalination, application of nano-based products, seed biopriming), and/or institutional solutions (salinity monitoring, integrated national and regional strategies) are very effective against salinity/salt stress and numerous other constraints.

These eukaryotic filamentous pathogens secrete effector proteins to facilitate plant infection. Fungi and oomycete pathogens have diverse infection strategies and their effectors generally do not share sequence homology. However, they occupy similar host environments, either the plant apoplast or plant cytoplasm, and, therefore, may share some unifying properties based on the requirements of these host compartments. Here, we exploit these biological signals and present the first classifier (EffectorP 3.0) that uses two machine-learning models: one trained on apoplastic effectors and one trained on cytoplasmic effectors. EffectorP 3.0 accurately predicts known apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors in fungal and oomycete secretomes with low estimated false-positive rates of 3 and 8%, respectively. Cytoplasmic effectors have a higher proportion of positively charged amino acids, whereas apoplastic effectors are enriched for cysteine residues. The combination of fungal and oomycete effectors in training leads to a higher number of predicted cytoplasmic effectors in biotrophic fungi. EffectorP 3.0 expands predicted effector repertoires beyond small, cysteine-rich secreted proteins in fungi and RxLR-motif containing secreted proteins in oomycetes. We show that signal peptide prediction is essential for accurate effector prediction, because EffectorP 3.0 recognizes a cytoplasmic signal also in intracellular, nonsecreted proteins. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Fungus–plant Interactions; Oomycete–plant Interactions; Fungal Proteins; Fungal Protein; Cytoplasm; Fungus; Metabolism; Microbiology; Oomycetes; Plant; Plant Disease; Cytoplasm; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Plant Diseases; Plants|fungal protein; cytoplasm; fungus; metabolism; microbiology; Oomycetes; plant; plant disease; Cytoplasm; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Plant Diseases; Plants|Article|Final|All Open Access; Gold Open Access|Scopus|2-s2.0-85124794564|32; 71|212.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9385-8588; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0620-5923|effectorp prediction apoplastic cytoplasmic effectors fungi oomycetes|many fungi oomycete species devasting plant pathogens eukaryotic filamentous pathogens secrete effector proteins facilitate plant infection fungi oomycete pathogens diverse infection strategies effectors generally share sequence homology however occupy similar host environments either plant apoplast plant cytoplasm therefore may share unifying properties based requirements host compartments exploit biological signals present first classifier effectorp uses two machinelearning models one trained apoplastic effectors one trained cytoplasmic effectors effectorp accurately predicts known apoplastic cytoplasmic effectors fungal oomycete secretomes low estimated falsepositive rates respectively cytoplasmic effectors higher proportion positively charged amino acids whereas apoplastic effectors enriched cysteine residues combination fungal oomycete effectors training leads higher number predicted cytoplasmic effectors biotrophic fungi effectorp expands predicted effector repertoires beyond small cysteinerich secreted proteins fungi rxlrmotif containing secreted proteins oomycetes show signal peptide prediction essential accurate effector prediction effectorp recognizes cytoplasmic signal also intracellular nonsecreted proteins elsevier bv rights reserved|fungusplant interactions oomyceteplant interactions fungal proteins fungal protein cytoplasm fungus metabolism microbiology oomycetes plant plant disease cytoplasm fungal proteins fungi plant diseases plants|fungal protein cytoplasm fungus metabolism microbiology oomycetes plant plant disease cytoplasm fungal proteins fungi plant diseases plants|['J., Sperschneider, Jana', 'P.N., Dodds, Peter N.']|['Sperschneider, Jana (23993365900)', 'Dodds, Peter N.

It has various mineral contents and vitamins so it is taken as a nutritive supplement food in the period of drought. So these types of plant have to be cultivated at most care for the survival of people. The cassava plant production is very easy with the tropical climate but with the sudden change in the climate level and watering issues there may be a infection caused by fungus. So far the fungal infections are identified using a manual method because it will occur in the root and leaves. Inorder to identify the level and variety of fungal or viral disease manual examination have to be made. However, this is time-consuming, costly, and lacks the knowledge to recognize the disease at the proper time. This leads the farmers to apply preventive strategies to non-infected cassava plants and affects the yields. This have been done to identify and categorize few kinds of disease infected on the cassava plant as it will be easy for the farm workers to take a preventive measure on time. This work mainly focuses on three different viral diseases of cassava plant namely Cassava Bacterial Blight, Cassava Mosaic Disease, Cassava Green Mite, Cassava Brown streak Disease and a healthy plant in order to expedite disease identification.

Lime is rich 10 source of vitamin C which works as an immunity booster in human body. Because of the late and manually diseases detection in lime causes a vast loss in crop production worldwide. The most common diseases are found in limes are lime canker, lemon scab, brown rot, sooty mould and Armillaria. In this paper we used imaging and non-imaging (spectral based sensing) methods with the combination of machine learning technique to detect the lime canker and sooty mould diseases.

In the agricultural industry, plant diseases and pests pose the greatest risks. Lime is rich 10 source of vitamin C which works as an immunity booster in human body. Because of the late and manually diseases detection in lime causes a vast loss in crop production worldwide. The most common diseases are found in limes are lime canker, lemon scab, brown rot, sooty mould and Armillaria. In this paper we used imaging and non-imaging (spectral based sensing) methods with the combination of machine learning technique to detect the lime canker and sooty mould diseases. Image acquirement, pre-processing, segmentation and classification are all steps in the imaging methodology, which is then followed by feature extraction. In non-imaging methodology a multispectral sensor (Spectrometer) is used with 400 nm to 1000 nm wavelength to detect the diseases. training set and test set ratio is fixed for both techniques are 75% and 25% respectively.

As sUAS capabilities continue to increase (i.e., payload, flight time, and speed), their potential in commercial row crop production is substantial. However, like other forms of remote sensing, traditional sUAS are limited to a nadir view of the target and only capture the top of the crop canopy.

Plant innate immunity relies on a broad repertoire of receptor proteins that can detect pathogens and trigger an effective defense response. Bioinformatic tools based on conserved domain and sequence similarity are within the most popular strategies for protein identification and characterization. However, the multi-domain nature, high sequence diversity and complex evolutionary history of disease resistance (DR) proteins make their prediction a real challenge. Here we present RFPDR, which pioneers the application of Random Forest (RF) for Plant DR protein prediction. Methods. A recently published collection of experimentally validated DR proteins was used as a positive dataset, while 10x10 nested datasets, ranging from 400-4,000 non-DR proteins, were used as negative datasets. A total of 9,631 features were extracted from each protein sequence, and included in a full dimension (FD) RFPDR model. Sequence selection was performed, to generate a reduced-dimension (RD) RFPDR model. Model performances were evaluated using an 80/20 (training/testing) partition, with 10- cross fold validation, and compared to baseline, sequence-based and state-of-the-art strategies. To gain some insights into the underlying biology, the most discriminatory sequence-based features in the RF classifier were identified. Results and Discussion. RD-RFPDR showed to be sensitive (86.4 ± 4.0%) and specific (96.9 ± 1.5%) for identifying DR proteins, while robust to data imbalance. Its high performance and robustness, added to the fact that RD-RFPDR provides valuable information related to DR proteins underlying properties, make RD-RFPDR an interesting approach for DR protein prediction, complementing the state-of-the-art strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Defense Response;

Growing plants at home have become a hobby as well as a nutrient factor. It also ensures that the vegetables and plants are pesticide-free and contain nutrients like antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals as a whole. But growing plants at home is not that easy as they get affected by different diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses which raise the need to identify them to prevent them from causing health issues to humans. This paper identifies the common diseases that affect vegetables like affect tomatoes, potatoes, corn, pepper leaves by using an android mobile application which is generally diagnosed by human visual confirmation. The Application allows gardeners to input the image of the diseased plant. The image is then converted and processed with the trained model against the common symptoms include water-soaked, gray-green spots, and dark circular spots.

The growth of every country depends on its agricultural growth. Growing plants at home have become a hobby as well as a nutrient factor. It also ensures that the vegetables and plants are pesticide-free and contain nutrients like antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals as a whole. But growing plants at home is not that easy as they get affected by different diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses which raise the need to identify them to prevent them from causing health issues to humans. This paper identifies the common diseases that affect vegetables like affect tomatoes, potatoes, corn, pepper leaves by using an android mobile application which is generally diagnosed by human visual confirmation. The Application allows gardeners to input the image of the diseased plant. The image is then converted and processed with the trained model against the common symptoms include water-soaked, gray-green spots, and dark circular spots. This process will be done by using a dataset which is a collection of all infected leaves images that will be processed through an image processing and train it by using CNN that extracts and learn the features. This project aims to help house-gardeners identify plant leaf diseases to ensure their health, raise the productivity and quality of plants. Deep learning is introduced to tackle this problem to raise the quality and quantity of plant production and to ensure public health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|6|0.41546994|Tópico 7: model, data, study

However, the coordination of sRNAs and proteins in the process of M. oryzae infecting rice is still poorly understood. Therefore, the combination of transcriptomics and proteomics to study the mechanism of M. oryzae infecting rice has important theoretical significance and practical value for controlling rice diseases and improving rice yields. In this paper, we used the high-throughput data of various omics before and after the M. oryzae infecting rice to screen differentially expressed genes and sRNAs and predict protein interaction pairs based on the interolog and the domain-domain methods. We were then used to construct a prediction model of the M. oryzae-rice interaction proteins according to the obtained proteins in the proteomic network. Finally, for the differentially expressed genes, differentially expressed sRNAs, the corresponding mRNAs of rice and M. oryzae, and the interacting protein molecules, the M. oryzae-rice sRNA regulatory network was built and analyzed, the core nodes were selected. The functional enrichment analysis was conducted to explore the potential effect pathways and the critical infection factors of M. oryzae sRNAs and proteins were mined and analyzed. The results showed that 22 sRNAs of M. oryzae, 77 secretory proteins of M. oryzae were used as effect factors to participate in the infection process of M. oryzae.

Recent breakthroughs in protein structure modeling have demonstrated the feasibility to predict the protein folds without depending on homologous templates. These advances enabled a genome-wide computational structural biology approach to help understand proteins based on their predicted folds. In this study, we employed structure prediction methods on the secretome of the destructive fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Out of 1,854 secreted proteins, we predicted the folds of 1,295 proteins (70%). We showed that template-free modeling by TrRosetta captured 514 folds missed by homology modeling, including many known effectors and virulence factors, and that TrRosetta generally produced higher quality models for secreted proteins. Along with sensitive homology search, we employed structure-based clustering, defining not only homologous groups with divergent members but also sequence-unrelated structurally analogous groups. We demonstrate that this approach can reveal new putative members of structurally similar MAX effectors and novel analogous effector families present in M. oryzae and possibly in other phytopathogens. We also investigated the evolution of expanded putative ADP-ribose transferases with predicted structures. We suggest that the loss of catalytic activities of the enzymes might have led them to new evolutionary trajectories to be specialized as protein binders. Collectively, we propose that computational structural genomics approaches can be an integral part of studying effector biology and provide valuable resources that were inaccessible before the advent of machine learning-based structure prediction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Computational Structural Genomics; Effectors; Fungal Effectors; Fungus–plant Interactions; Genomics; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Phytopathogen; Structure; Fungal Proteins; Fungal Protein; Ascomycetes; Genetics; Genomics; Magnaporthe; Metabolism; Oryza; Plant Disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Genomics; Plant Diseases; Secretome|fungal protein; Ascomycetes; genetics; genomics; Magnaporthe; metabolism; Oryza; plant disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Genomics; Plant Diseases; Secretome|Article|Final|All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access|Scopus|2-s2.0-85122441203|11; 34|212.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7711-0107; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1679-0700|computational structural genomics unravels common folds novel families secretome fungal phytopathogen magnaporthe oryzae|structural biology potential illuminate evolution pathogen effectors commonalities cannot readily detected primary sequence level recent breakthroughs protein structure modeling demonstrated feasibility predict protein folds without depending homologous templates advances enabled genomewide computational structural biology approach help understand proteins based predicted folds study employed structure prediction methods secretome destructive fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae secreted proteins predicted folds proteins showed templatefree modeling trrosetta captured folds missed homology modeling including many known effectors virulence factors trrosetta generally produced higher quality models secreted proteins along sensitive homology search employed structurebased clustering defining homologous groups divergent members also sequenceunrelated structurally analogous groups demonstrate approach reveal new putative members structurally similar max effectors novel analogous effector families present oryzae possibly phytopathogens also investigated evolution expanded putative adpribose transferases predicted structures suggest loss catalytic activities enzymes might led new evolutionary trajectories specialized protein binders collectively propose computational structural genomics approaches integral part studying effector biology provide valuable resources inaccessible advent machine learningbased structure prediction elsevier bv rights reserved|computational structural genomics effectors fungal effectors fungusplant interactions genomics magnaporthe oryzae phytopathogen structure fungal proteins fungal protein ascomycetes genetics genomics magnaporthe metabolism oryza plant disease ascomycota fungal proteins genomics plant diseases secretome|fungal protein ascomycetes genetics genomics magnaporthe metabolism oryza plant disease ascomycota fungal proteins genomics plant diseases secretome|['K., Seong, Kyungyong', 'K.V., Krasileva, Ksenia V.']|['Seong, Kyungyong (57204643107)', 'Krasileva, Ksenia V.

Recent studies with remote sensing (RS) sensors at different scales have shown that Xf-infected olive trees have distinct spectral features in the visible and infrared regions (VNIR). However, further work is needed to integrate remote sensing in the management of plant disease epidemics. Here, we research how the spectral changes picked up by different sets of RS plant traits (i.e., pigments, structural or leaf protein content), can help capture the spatial dynamics of Xf spread. We coupled a spatial spread model with the probability of Xf-infection predicted by a RS-driven support vector machine (RS-SVM) model. Furthermore, we analyzed which RS plant traits contribute most to the output of the prediction models. For that, in almond orchards affected by Xf (n = 1426 trees), we conducted a field campaign simultaneously with an airborne campaign to collect high-resolution thermal images and hyperspectral images in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400–850 nm) and short-wave infrared regions (SWIR, 950–1700 nm). The best performing RS-SVM model (OA = 75%; kappa = 0.50) included as predictors leaf protein content, nitrogen indices (NIs), fluorescence and a thermal indicator (T<inf>c</inf>), alongside pigments and structural parameters. Leaf protein content together with NIs contributed 28% to the explanatory power of the model, followed by chlorophyll (22%), structural parameters (LAI and LIDF<inf>a</inf>), and chlorophyll indicators of photosynthetic efficiency. Coupling the RS model with an epidemic spread model increased the accuracy (OA = 80%; kappa = 0.48). In the almond trees where the presence of Xf was assayed by qPCR (n = 318 trees), the combined RS-spread model yielded an OA of 71% and kappa = 0.33, which is higher than the RS-only model and visual inspections (both OA = 64–65% and kappa = 0.26–31). Our work demonstrates how combining spatial epidemiological models and remote sensing can lead to highly accurate predictions of plant disease spatial distribution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Epidemic Spread Model;

The essential nutrients like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen are obtained from sunlight, air, and water to prepare food and plant growth. For healthy growth, plants also need macronutrients such as Potassium, Calcium, Nitrogen, Sulphur, Magnesium, and Phosphorus in relatively great quantities. When a plant doesn’t find necessary nutrients for its growth inadequate amount, deficiency of plant nutrients occur. Plants exhibit various symptoms to indicate the deficiency. Automatic identification and differentiation of these deficiencies are very important in the greenhouse environment. Deep Neural Networks are extremely efficient in image categorization problems. In this work, we used the part of the pre-trained deep learning model i.e. Transfer Learning model to detect the nutrient stress in the plant. We compared three different architectures including Inception-V3, ResNet50, and VGG16 with two classifiers: RF and SVM to improve, classification accuracy. A total of 880 images of Calcium and Magnesium deficiencies in the Tomato plant from the greenhouse were collected to form a dataset.

Plants need nutrients to develop normally. The essential nutrients like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen are obtained from sunlight, air, and water to prepare food and plant growth. For healthy growth, plants also need macronutrients such as Potassium, Calcium, Nitrogen, Sulphur, Magnesium, and Phosphorus in relatively great quantities. When a plant doesn’t find necessary nutrients for its growth inadequate amount, deficiency of plant nutrients occur. Plants exhibit various symptoms to indicate the deficiency. Automatic identification and differentiation of these deficiencies are very important in the greenhouse environment. Deep Neural Networks are extremely efficient in image categorization problems. In this work, we used the part of the pre-trained deep learning model i.e. Transfer Learning model to detect the nutrient stress in the plant. We compared three different architectures including Inception-V3, ResNet50, and VGG16 with two classifiers: RF and SVM to improve, classification accuracy. A total of 880 images of Calcium and Magnesium deficiencies in the Tomato plant from the greenhouse were collected to form a dataset. For training, 704(80%) images are used and for testing, 176(20%) images are used to examine the model performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the largest accuracy of 99.14% has resulted for the VGG16 model with SVM classifier and 98.71% for Inception-V3 with Random Forest Classifier. For a batch size of 8 and epochs equal to 10, the Inception -V3 architecture attained the highest validation accuracy of 99.99% and the least validation loss of 0.0000384 on an average. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|4|0.40240237|Tópico 5: crop, soil, system

The small secretory proteins, explicitly known as effector proteins, are one of the prime mechanisms of host manipulation utilized by the pathogen to disarm the host. Several effector proteins are known to translocate from fungus to the plant cell for host manipulation. Many fungal effectors have been identified using genomic, transcriptomic, and bioinformatics approaches. Most of the effector proteins are devoid of any conserved signatures, and their prediction based on sequence homology is very challenging, therefore by combining the sequence consensus based upon machine learning features, multiple tools have also been developed for predicting apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors. Various post-genomics approaches like transcriptomics of virulent isolates have also been utilized for identifying active consortia of effectors. Significant progress has been made in understanding biotrophic effectors; however, most of it is underway due to their complex interaction with host and complicated recognition and signaling networks.

Alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms of the same gene may sometimes have very similar sequence, but they can have significantly diverse effects on cellular function and regulation. The products of alternative splicing have important and diverse functional roles, such as response to environmental stress, regulation of gene expression, human heritable, and plant diseases. The mRNA isoforms of the same gene can have dramatically different functions. Despite the functional importance of mRNA isoforms, very little has been done to annotate their functions.

Multiple mRNA isoforms of the same gene are produced via alternative splicing, a biological mechanism that regulates protein diversity while maintaining genome size. Alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms of the same gene may sometimes have very similar sequence, but they can have significantly diverse effects on cellular function and regulation. The products of alternative splicing have important and diverse functional roles, such as response to environmental stress, regulation of gene expression, human heritable, and plant diseases. The mRNA isoforms of the same gene can have dramatically different functions. Despite the functional importance of mRNA isoforms, very little has been done to annotate their functions. The recent years have however seen the development of several computational methods aimed at predicting mRNA isoform level biological functions. These methods use a wide array of proteo-genomic data to develop machine learning-based mRNA isoform function prediction tools.

Additionally, pulses are important sources of soil nitrogen in rotational cropping systems. However, pulse production is limited by several biotic and abiotic stress factors. One such disease is Ascochyta blight (Ascochyta rabiei) in chickpea. To minimize the impact of Ascochyta blight, timely information on disease outbreak and epidemics is essential for implementing disease control methods. Thus, in this study, the feasibility of monitoring Ascochyta blight disease severity in chickpea using remote sensing techniques was evaluated. Disease severity was monitored using an unmanned aircraft system integrated with different types of sensors (3-band multispectral, 5-band multispectral, and thermal cameras). Results indicated that different flight altitudes (60 m and 90 m above ground level) that lead to different image resolutions did not influence disease detection efficiency, especially with the 3-band camera. Selected image features, including canopy area, percentage of canopy area, and vegetation indices (e.g., green normalized difference vegetation index) from multispectral cameras, and mean canopy temperature from the thermal camera, were significantly correlated with yield and visual ratings of disease severity. Moreover, hyperspectral sensing was found to be useful in predicting disease severity. In summary, this study demonstrated that disease severity of Ascochyta blight in chickpea can be monitored using remote sensing methods under active field conditions.

Nutrient deficiency is the cause of serious diseases in plant growth, affecting crop yield. In this article, we employed artificial neural network models to recognize, classify, and predict the nutritional deficiencies occurring in tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.). To classify and predict the different macronutrient deficiencies in the cropping process, this paper handles the captured images of the macronutrient deficiency.

A total of 571 images were captured with tomato leaves and fruits containing the crop species at the growth stage. Among all images, 80% (461 captured images) were used for the training dataset and 20% (110 captured images) were applied for the validation dataset. In this study, we provide an analysis of two different model architectures based on convolutional neural network for classifying and predicting the nutrient deficiency symptoms.

Moreover, a major type of statistical structure, namely Ensemble Averaging, was applied with two aforementioned predictive models to increase the accuracy of predictive validation. Three mineral nutrients, i.e., Calcium/Ca2+, Potassium/K+, and Nitrogen/N, are considered for use in evaluating the nutrient status in the development of tomato plant with these models. The aim of this study is to predict the nutrient deficiency accurately in order to increase crop production and prevent the emergence of tomato pathology caused by lack of nutrients. The predictive performance of the three models in this paper are validated, with the accuracy rates of 87.273% and 79.091% for Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder, respectively, and with 91% validity using Ensemble Averaging. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Autoencoder; Classification; Deep Learning; Ensemble Averaging; Inception-resnet V2; Nutrient Deficiency; Prediction; Tomato Plant|Desconocido|Article|Final|All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access|Scopus|2-s2.0-85067101930|7; 26; 1; 20|195.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8362-0795; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4253-126X; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1343-5404|comparative study deep cnn forecasting classifying macronutrient deficiencies development tomato plant|process plant growth flowering stages fruit development plants need provided various minerals nutrients grow nutrient deficiency cause serious diseases plant growth affecting crop yield article employed artificial neural network models recognize classify predict nutritional deficiencies occurring tomato plants solanum lycopersicum l classify predict different macronutrient deficiencies cropping process paper handles captured images macronutrient deficiency deficiency fruiting leafing phases tomato plant based deep convolutional neural network cnn total images captured tomato leaves fruits containing crop species growth stage among images captured images used training dataset captured images applied validation dataset study provide analysis two different model architectures based convolutional neural network classifying predicting nutrient deficiency symptoms instance inceptionresnet v autoencoder captured images tomato plant growth greenhouse conditions moreover major type statistical structure namely ensemble averaging applied two aforementioned predictive models increase accuracy predictive validation three mineral nutrients ie calciumca potassiumk nitrogenn considered use evaluating nutrient status development tomato plant models aim study predict nutrient deficiency accurately order increase crop production prevent emergence tomato pathology caused lack nutrients predictive performance three models paper validated accuracy rates inceptionresnet v autoencoder respectively validity using ensemble averaging elsevier bv rights reserved|autoencoder classification deep learning ensemble averaging inceptionresnet v nutrient deficiency prediction tomato plant|desconocido|['T.T., Tran, Tin Trung', 'J., Choi, Jae-won', 'T.T.H., Le, Thien Tu Huynh', 'J., Kim, Jongwook']|['Tran, Tin Trung (57189065129)', 'Choi, Jae-won (57197732028)', 'Le, Thien Tu Huynh (57209266701)', 'Kim, Jongwook (56196402100)']|['https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8362-0795', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4253-126X', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1343-5404']|['Autoencoder', 'Classification', 'Deep Learning', 'Ensemble Averaging', 'Inception-resnet V2', 'Nutrient Deficiency', 'Prediction', 'Tomato Plant']|['Desconocido']|['autoencoder', 'ensemble averaging', 'inception-resnet v2', 'nutrient deficiency', 'tomato plant']|A comparative study of deep CNN in forecasting and classifying the macronutrient deficiencies on development of tomato plant. During the process of plant growth, such as during the flowering stages and fruit development, the plants need to be provided with the various minerals and nutrients to grow. Nutrient deficiency is the cause of serious diseases in plant growth, affecting crop yield. In this article, we employed artificial neural network models to recognize, classify, and predict the nutritional deficiencies occurring in tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.). To classify and predict the different macronutrient deficiencies in the cropping process, this paper handles the captured images of the macronutrient deficiency. This deficiency during the fruiting and leafing phases of tomato plant are based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). A total of 571 images were captured with tomato leaves and fruits containing the crop species at the growth stage. Among all images, 80% (461 captured images) were used for the training dataset and 20% (110 captured images) were applied for the validation dataset. In this study, we provide an analysis of two different model architectures based on convolutional neural network for classifying and predicting the nutrient deficiency symptoms.

Considering that the experimental identification of plant-pathogen PPIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, computationalmethods are emerging as an important strategy to complement the experimentalmethods. In this work, we first evaluated the performance of traditional computationalmethods such as interolog, domain-domain interaction and domain-motif interaction in predicting known plant-pathogen PPIs. Owing to the low sensitivity of the traditionalmethods, we utilized RandomForest to build an interspecies PPI predictionmodel based onmultiple sequence encodings and novel network attributes in the established plant PPI network. Critical assessment of the features demonstrated that the integration of sequence information and network attributes resulted in significant and robust performance improvement. Additionally, we also discussed the influence of Gene Ontology and gene expression information on the prediction performance. TheWeb server implementing the integrated predictionmethod, named InterSPPI, has beenmade freely available at http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/intersppi/index.php. InterSPPI could achieve a reasonably high accuracy with a precision of 73.8% and a recall of 76.6% in the independent test. To examine the applicability of InterSPPI, we also conducted cross-species and proteome-wide plant-pathogen PPI prediction tests. Taken together, we hope this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of the current status of plant-pathogen PPI predictions, and the proposed InterSPPI can become a useful tool to accelerate the exploration of plant-pathogen interactions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Feature Integration; Machine Learning; Plant-pathogen Interaction; Prediction; Protein-protein Interaction;

Nutrient status should thus be examined not by establishing the effects of single nutrient deficiencies on the physiological state of the plant but by combinations of them. Differences in the nutrient content significantly affect the photochemical process of photosynthesis therefore playing a crucial role in plants growth and development. In this work, an attempt was made to find a connection between element content in (i) different soils, (ii) plant leaves, grown on these soils and (iii) changes in selected chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, in order to find a method for early detection of plant stress resulting from the combination of nutrient status in natural conditions. To achieve this goal, a mathematical procedure was used which combines principal component analysis (a tool for the reduction of data complexity), hierarchical k-means (a classification method) and a machine-learning method—super-organising maps. Differences in the mineral content of soil and plant leaves resulted in functional changes in the photosynthetic machinery that can be measured by chlorophyll a fluorescent signals. Five groups of patterns in the chlorophyll fluorescent parameters were established: the ‘no deficiency’, Fe-specific deficiency, slight, moderate and strong deficiency. Unfavourable development in groups with nutrient deficiency of any kind was reflected by a strong increase in F<inf>o</inf> and ΔV/Δt<inf>0</inf> and decline in φ<inf>Po</inf>, φ<inf>Eo</inf>δ<inf>Ro</inf> and φ<inf>Ro</inf>. The strong deficiency group showed the suboptimal development of the photosynthetic machinery, which affects both PSII and PSI. The nutrient-deficient groups also differed in antenna complex organisation. Thus, our work suggests that the chlorophyll fluorescent method combined with machine-learning methods can be highly informative and in some cases, it can replace much more expensive and time-consuming procedures such as chemometric analyses. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Chlorophyll A Fluorescence; Machine Learning; Nutrient Status; Nutrient-deficiency Detection; Ojip Test; Super-organising Maps; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Soil; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Brassica Rapa; Chemistry; Fluorescence; Food; Photosynthesis; Physiological Stress; Physiology; Plant Leaf; Principal Component Analysis; Soil; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Food; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Principal Component Analysis; Soil; Stress, Physiological|chlorophyll; chlorophyll a; Brassica rapa; chemistry; fluorescence; food; photosynthesis; physiological stress; physiology; plant leaf; principal component analysis; soil; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Food; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Principal Component Analysis; Soil; Stress, Physiological|Article|Final|All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access|Scopus|2-s2.0-85035138906|58; 14; 8; 35; 13; 13; 5; 6; 8; 1; 6; 14|178.0||https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7428-0429; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0797-4863; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4338-6671; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6476-5243; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0428-6451; https://orcid.org/0009-0004-4788-7398; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4736-4704|chlorophyll fluorescence tool nutrient status identification rapeseed plants|natural conditions plants growth development depends environmental conditions including availability micro macroelements soil nutrient status thus examined establishing effects single nutrient deficiencies physiological state plant combinations differences nutrient content significantly affect photochemical process photosynthesis therefore playing crucial role plants growth development work attempt made find connection element content different soils ii plant leaves grown soils iii changes selected chlorophyll fluorescence parameters order find method early detection plant stress resulting combination nutrient status natural conditions achieve goal mathematical procedure used combines principal component analysis tool reduction data complexity hierarchical kmeans classification method machinelearning methodsuperorganising maps differences mineral content soil plant leaves resulted functional changes photosynthetic machinery measured chlorophyll fluorescent signals five groups patterns chlorophyll fluorescent parameters established deficiency fespecific deficiency slight moderate strong deficiency unfavourable development groups nutrient deficiency kind reflected strong increase finfoinf δvδtinfinf decline φinfpoinf φinfeoinfδinfroinf φinfroinf strong deficiency group showed suboptimal development photosynthetic machinery affects psii psi nutrientdeficient groups also differed antenna complex organisation thus work suggests chlorophyll fluorescent method combined machinelearning methods highly informative cases replace much expensive timeconsuming procedures chemometric analyses elsevier bv rights reserved|chlorophyll fluorescence machine learning nutrient status nutrientdeficiency detection ojip test superorganising maps chlorophyll chlorophyll chlorophyll chlorophyll soil chlorophyll chlorophyll brassica rapa chemistry fluorescence food photosynthesis physiological stress physiology plant leaf principal component analysis soil chlorophyll fluorescence food photosynthesis plant leaves principal component analysis soil stress physiological|chlorophyll chlorophyll brassica rapa chemistry fluorescence food photosynthesis physiological stress physiology plant leaf principal component analysis soil chlorophyll fluorescence food photosynthesis plant leaves principal component analysis soil stress physiological|['H.M., Kalaji, Hazem M.', 'W., Ba̧ba, Wojciech', 'K., Gediga, Krzysztof', 'V.N., Goltsev, Vasilij N.', 'I.A., Samborska, Izabela Anna', 'M.D., Cetner, Magdalena Danuta', 'S.G., Dimitrova, Stella G.', 'U., Piszcz, Urszula', 'K., Bielecki, Krzysztof', 'K., Karmowska, Kamila']|['Kalaji, Hazem M.

Plants, in turn, have developed diverse defense mechanisms to identify and evade different pathogenic microorganisms. Early identification of plant disease resistance genes (R genes) can be exploited for crop improvement programs. The present prediction methods are either based on sequence similarity/domain-based methods or electronically annotated sequences, which might miss existing unrecognized proteins or low similarity proteins. Therefore, there is an urgent need to devise a novel machine learning technique to address this problem. In the current study, a SVM-based tool was developed for prediction of disease resistance proteins in plants. All known disease resistance (R) proteins (112) were taken as a positive set, whereas manually curated negative dataset consisted of 119 R proteins. Feature extraction generated 10,270 features using 16 different methods. The ten-fold cross validation was performed to optimize SVM parameters using radial basis function. The model was derived using libSVM and achieved an overall accuracy of 91.11% on the test dataset. The tool was found to be robust and can be used for high-throughput datasets. The current study provides instant identification of R proteins using machine learning approach, in addition to the similarity or domain prediction methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Domain Class;

In plant hosts, the viral proteins have several basic science implications and biotechnology applications. However in silico identification of these proteins is limited by their high sequence diversity. In this study we developed supervised learning based classification models for plant viral RNA silencing suppressor proteins in plant viruses. We developed four classifiers based on supervised learning algorithms: J48, Random Forest, LibSVM and Naïve Bayes algorithms, with enriched model learning by correlation based feature selection. Structural and physicochemical features calculated for experimentally verified primary protein sequences were used to train the classifiers. The training features include amino acid composition; auto correlation coefficients; composition, transition, and distribution of various physicochemical properties; and pseudo amino acid composition. Performance analysis of predictive models based on 10 fold cross-validation and independent data testing revealed that the Random Forest based model was the best and achieved 86.11% overall accuracy and 86.22% balanced accuracy with a remarkably high area under the Receivers Operating Characteristic curve of 0.95 to predict viral RNA silencing suppressor proteins. The prediction models for plant viral RNA silencing suppressors can potentially aid identification of novel viral RNA silencing suppressors, which will provide valuable insights into the mechanism of RNA silencing and could be further explored as potential targets for designing novel antiviral therapeutics. Also, the key subset of identified optimal features may help in determining compositional patterns in the viral proteins which are important determinants for RNA silencing suppressor activities.

A mesophyll colonizer, Xoc differs from X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which invades xylem to cause bacterial blight of rice. Both produce multiple distinct TAL effectors, type III-delivered proteins that transactivate effector-specific host genes. A TAL effector finds its target(s) via a partially degenerate code whereby the modular effector amino acid sequence identifies nucleotide sequences to which the protein binds. Virulence contributions of some Xoo TAL effectors have been shown, and their relevant targets, susceptibility (S) genes, identified, but the role of TAL effectors in leaf streak is uncharacterized. We used host transcript profiling to compare leaf streak to blight and to probe functions of Xoc TAL effectors. We found that Xoc and Xoo induce almost completely different host transcriptional changes. Roughly one in three genes upregulated by the pathogens is preceded by a candidate TAL effector binding element. Experimental analysis of the 44 such genes predicted to be Xoc TAL effector targets verified nearly half, and identified most others as false predictions. None of the Xoc targets is a known bacterial blight S gene. Mutational analysis revealed that Tal2g, which activates two genes, contributes to lesion expansion and bacterial exudation. Use of designer TAL effectors discriminated a sulfate transporter gene as the S gene. Across all targets, basal expression tended to be higher than genome-average, and induction moderate. Finally, machine learning applied to real vs. falsely predicted targets yielded a classifier that recalled 92% of the real targets with 88% precision, providing a tool for better target prediction in the future. Our study expands the number of known TAL effector targets, identifies a new class of S gene, and improves our ability to predict functional targeting. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|Transcription Activator Like Effector;

Bacterial leaf streak of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is an increasingly important yield constraint in this staple crop. A mesophyll colonizer, Xoc differs from X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which invades xylem to cause bacterial blight of rice. Both produce multiple distinct TAL effectors, type III-delivered proteins that transactivate effector-specific host genes. A TAL effector finds its target(s) via a partially degenerate code whereby the modular effector amino acid sequence identifies nucleotide sequences to which the protein binds. Virulence contributions of some Xoo TAL effectors have been shown, and their relevant targets, susceptibility (S) genes, identified, but the role of TAL effectors in leaf streak is uncharacterized. We used host transcript profiling to compare leaf streak to blight and to probe functions of Xoc TAL effectors. We found that Xoc and Xoo induce almost completely different host transcriptional changes. Roughly one in three genes upregulated by the pathogens is preceded by a candidate TAL effector binding element. Experimental analysis of the 44 such genes predicted to be Xoc TAL effector targets verified nearly half, and identified most others as false predictions. None of the Xoc targets is a known bacterial blight S gene. Mutational analysis revealed that Tal2g, which activates two genes, contributes to lesion expansion and bacterial exudation. Use of designer TAL effectors discriminated a sulfate transporter gene as the S gene. Across all targets, basal expression tended to be higher than genome-average, and induction moderate. Finally, machine learning applied to real vs. falsely predicted targets yielded a classifier that recalled 92% of the real targets with 88% precision, providing a tool for better target prediction in the future. Our study expands the number of known TAL effector targets, identifies a new class of S gene, and improves our ability to predict functional targeting. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.|2|0.70250505|Tópico 3: protein, effector, sequence

Every year, diseases and pests harm apple production by a significant amount of money. Farmers face a challenge in identifying distinct apple illnesses because the symptoms of different illnesses can be extremely similar and occur at the same time. Therefore, Leaf Disease Prediction (LDP) in apple cultivation is considerably important to overcome these problems.

Agriculture has a vital role in the development of any country like India where the majority of the population’s livelihood depends on agriculture. Every year, diseases and pests harm apple production by a significant amount of money. Farmers face a challenge in identifying distinct apple illnesses because the symptoms of different illnesses can be extremely similar and occur at the same time. Therefore, Leaf Disease Prediction (LDP) in apple cultivation is considerably important to overcome these problems. In this work, an overview of the taxonomy of apple plant diseases is discussed with their symptoms, cause, and effect. This study concluded that the method used for automatic detection and classification of apple plant diseases is still in its infancy. Hence, a new efficient model is required for the detection and classification of apple plant leaf disease that can save the farmer from loss as well as help them in increasing the production of apples.|1|0.50889885|Tópico 2: tomato, fruit, grape

However, mulberry trees are highly susceptible to diseases, spreading rapidly and causing significant losses. Manual disease identification across large farms is arduous and time-consuming. Leveraging computer vision for early disease detection and classification can mitigate up to 90% of production losses. This study collected leaves from two regions of Bangladesh, categorized as healthy, leaf rust-affected, and leaf spot-affected. With a total of 1091 images, split into training (764), testing (218), and validation (109) sets for 5-fold cross-validation, preprocessing and augmentation yielded 6,000 images, including synthetics. This study compares ResNet50, VGG19, and MobileNetV3Small on a specific task following architecture modifications. Four convolutional layers with different output channels (512, 128, 64, and 32) were added to baseline models. We assessed how these architectural changes affected model correctness, computing efficiency, and convergence rates. Comparing three pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - MobileNetV3Small, ResNet50, and VGG19 - augmented with four additional layers, the modified MobileNetV3Small excelled in precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, achieving notable results of 97.0%, 96.4%, 96.4%, and 96.4%, respectively, across cross-validation folds. An efficient smartphone application employing the proposed model for mulberry leaf disease recognition was developed. Overall, the model outperformed existing State of the Art (SOTA) approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in disease identification.

Tomato plants are unfortunately prone to a number of illnesses, which can result in decreased production and quality and substantial financial losses. Grey leaf spot is one of the most prevalent diseases affecting tomato plants. It damages and destroys the leaves, which eventually prevents the plant from bearing fruit. Contact, invasion, latency, and onset are the four stages of the infection that the pathogen that causes grey leaf spot in tomato plants goes through. Early illness detection can provide effective management strategies and potentially avert widespread pandemics. Solanum lycopersicum, often known as the South Indian tomato, is a widely used vegetable in cooking. The tomato plant is widely cultivated and regarded as a significant agricultural commodity due to its ability to adapt to a range of environmental conditions and its abundance in potassium, vitamins C and K, and other minerals. However, growing tomatoes is not without its difficulties. Leaf diseases, which can reduce yields by as much as 60%, are one major challenge.

Beetroot crops are essential to the world's food systems, but several illnesses often affect their quality and productivity. To suggest a CNN model using federated learning to analyse data from several clients while preserving privacy for a quick and precise diagnosis. The method analyses the severity of the five stages of beetroot leaf diseases using a federated learning technique across several local clients to use precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy as performance measurements. The review showed that performance had improved consistently for all customers. As an example, Client X had a prediction accuracy of 0.97, which increased gradually to 0.98 for both Client P and Client R. Additionally, as shown by the macro-average (94.15-94.17%), weighted average (94.67%), and micro-average (94.62%) scores for top-performing customers, the model's performance remained stable and resilient throughout all severity levels. The study's findings support using a CNN model built on federated learning for scalable, effective, and privacy-preserving disease control in agriculture. The promising results suggest the potential for extending such approaches to other agricultural products, considerably advancing efforts to ensure global food security. The research also showed that the CNN model could learn and develop continuously in a federated learning scenario, highlighting its usefulness as a dynamic tool that adapts to new illness patterns. A paradigm shift in the approach to combating agricultural illnesses and increasing food supply is heralded by this study, which reveals a potential junction between machine learning and agricultural disease management.
