abstract = {Radio Telescopes for SETI searches are less demanding than general purpose astronomical radio telescopes. This provides an opportunity to exploit economical approaches in designing SETI systems. Radio Telescopes in low Earth orbit offer no discernible advantages to SETI; indeed, they probably would perform more poorly than a telescope in any other location. Telescopes in geosynchronous orbits would be sufficiently far from Earth to mitigate greatly the deleterious effect of human radio transmissions. Telescopes on the far side of the moon would be superb both from a radio interference standpoint, and from a civil engineering standpoint. Single-reflector telescopes as large as 50 kilometers in diameter could be constructed with conventional materials. However, their costs appear prohibitive. The asteroid belt and the outer solar system are unpromising places to place a large radio telescope. Perhaps the ultimate radio telescope would utilize the sun as a gravitational lens, focusing radiation on free-flying 10-meter class or possibly larger radio telescopes located at distances of the order of 1000 A.U. from the sun. Such a combination has an energy collecting area at 10 centimeters wavelength equivalent to that of a radio telescope about 11 kilometers in diameter, or of the order of 3000 Arecibo radio telescopes. Such a system could detect transmitters with EIRP of the order of a gigawatt at a distance of the order of the distance to the galactic center.}

abstract = {Background and Objective
Diagnosis as the initial step of medical practice, is one of the most important parts of complicated clinical decision making which is usually accompanied with the degree of ambiguity and uncertainty. Since uncertainty is the inseparable nature of medicine, fuzzy logic methods have been used as one of the best methods to decrease this ambiguity. Recently, several kinds of literature have been published related to fuzzy logic methods in a wide range of medical aspects in terms of diagnosis. However, in this context there are a few review articles that have been published which belong to almost ten years ago. Hence, we conducted a systematic review to determine the contribution of utilizing fuzzy logic methods in disease diagnosis in different medical practices.
Methods
Eight scientific databases are selected as an appropriate database and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method was employed as the basis method for conducting this systematic and meta-analysis review. Regarding the main objective of this research, some inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered to limit our investigation. To achieve a structured meta-analysis, all eligible articles were classified based on authors, publication year, journals or conferences, applied fuzzy methods, main objectives of the research, problems and research gaps, tools utilized to model the fuzzy system, medical disciplines, sample sizes, the inputs and outputs of the system, findings, results and finally the impact of applied fuzzy methods to improve diagnosis. Then, we analyzed the results obtained from these classifications to indicate the effect of fuzzy methods in decreasing the complexity of diagnosis.
Results
Consequently, the result of this study approved the effectiveness of applying different fuzzy methods in diseases diagnosis process, presenting new insights for researchers about what kind of diseases which have been more focused. This will help to determine the diagnostic aspects of medical disciplines that are being neglected.
Conclusions
Overall, this systematic review provides an appropriate platform for further research by identifying the research needs in the domain of disease diagnosis.}

abstract = {Aurora spacecraft is a scientific probe propelled by a “fast” solar sail whose first goal is to perform a technology assessment mission. The main characteristic of the sail is its low mass, which implies the absence of a plastic backing of the aluminum film and the lightness of the whole structure. In previous structural studies the limiting factor has been shown to be the elastic stability of a number of structural members subject to compressive loads. An alternative structural layout is here suggested: an inflatable beam, which is kept pressurized also after the deployment, relieves all compressive stresses, allowing a very simple configuration and a straightforward deployment procedure. However, as the mission profile requires a trajectory passing close to the Sun, a configuration different from the ‘parachute’ sail proposed in another paper, must be used.}

Early crewed missions to NEO's could analyze the objects' properties and evaluate resource-mining possibilities. Later missions to Earth-threatening 100-m radius NEO's could deploy NEO-centered, high-area, low-mass reflective structures. The solar gravitational parameter (GMsun) on a NEO is slightly reduced by increased radiation pressure. The central-force-field equations reveal that NEO eccentricity and average solar distance are thereby slightly increased. Given decades of warning and long-lived reflective canopies, such structures can convert Earth-impacts into near-misses. Although not suitable for NEO mining, such structures are superior to nuclear detonations because (as revealed by the 1994 Jupiter-comet interaction) NEO calving may be a consequence of explosions. NEO despinning is not required.}

abstract = {One of the most important challenges facing control system engineers is the design and implementation of intelligent control systems that can assist operators to make supervisory control decisions such as abnormal situations management (ASM), start up and shut down, controller performance assessment and so on. Operator failure to exercise the appropriate supervisory control decisions often have an adverse effect on product quality, process safety, occupational health and environmental impact. The economic impact of such abnormal situations is enormous; about $20 billion/year in losses in the petrochemical industries alone in the US. Furthermore, process safety, occupational health and environmental hazards are ever increasing in importance in response to heightening public concern and the resultant tightening of regulations. Thus, there exists considerable incentive in developing intelligent control systems that can provide automated operator assistance for supervisory control situations for complex process plants. People in the process industries view this as the next major challenge in control systems research and application. The automation of process fault detection and diagnosis forms the first step in automating supervisory control and ASM. In this paper, I present an overview of the various approaches to fault diagnosis, challenges we face and encouraging emerging trends. The recent progress has promising implications on the use of intelligent systems for inherently safer design, operator training, abnormal situation management, process hazards analysis and optimal process operations.}

Multi-view learning is to combine multiple view data of the same entity for data classification, thereby improving learning performance. Previous multi-view research methods mainly concentrate on the relationship between different data views for classification problems. However, when the data is in high dimensions, it is necessary to perform feature selection in the multi-view data classification process. In this paper, we proposed a Multi-view Support Vector Machine Classification with Feature Selection (MSVMCFS) algorithm, which can not only classify multi-view data, but also select features for each view data in the process of classification. In the model, feature selection is performed by the l1 norm sparsity regularization, and consistency and complementarity between the two views are maintained. To achieve the optimization goal, we adopt linear programming to solve the model. The experimental results on 30 binary datasets demonstrate the validity of the model.}

abstract = {The thrust model for computing a sailcraft trajectory contains thermo-optical parameters that are averages over the spectrum of the incident photons, namely, with respect to energy, intensity and polarization. These parameters are not observables and could change considerably from a sail to sail for a number of practical reasons. The mission analysis for a sailcraft is a progressive task from a simple trajectory propagator to the orbit determination. Aurora sailcraft mission analysis has advanced another step forward by processing experimental data related to aluminium. Once appropriate fitting functions have been selected, differential specular and diffused reflectance and differential absorptance have been averaged over incident solar spectrum, assumed a Planckian here. The result has been to get incident-angle-dependent optical parameters more reliable than mere literature values. The procedure has entailed the computation of grids of complicated definite integrals. They are particularly important during the trajectory optimization of the Aurora solar flyby, a very sensitive profile that would allow the sailcraft to achieve cruise speeds ranging from 12 to 20 AU/yr.}

The trajectory and ΔV requirements will be presented. An automated, on-board sky survey will be proposed to inventory the Kuiper objects in the vicinity of the flight path and to identify which objects are candidates for altering the trajectory for a close flyby.

But we know that on average twice in the every century the Earth comes into collision with the large celestial bodies (for example Tungussky or Arizonsky meteorites). The incidence of such meteorite in density population region of the Earth will simulate the ecumenical catastrophe. Much more seldom the Earth experiences collision with the particularly large celestial bodies. In accordance with one of the hypotheses namely the collision Earth with such body 65,000,000 years ago leads to the global change of Earth biosphere (in particular to the extinction of dinosaurs). Now we are able to stave off or at least to forewarn of this danger. One of the way for that is making the specific space station - asteroid patrol. Such the station will be able to track the approaching celestial bodies and perhaps (on second stage) to attempt altering its trajectory (for example with directional thermonuclear explosions) Some of the expedient points in the Space for the asteroid patrol's placing are the librations' points of the Earth - Moon system. In the report the preliminary results of analysis the problem of space station's taking into the libration's point are presented. For this taking it is suggested the electric jet propulsion to use.}

To accomplish the H-reversal mode, a sailcraft needs of all metal solar sail. The solar sail envisaged by the “AURORA Project” is composed of two metallic layers (AI and Cr) deposited on plastic substrate. To obtain an all metal solar sail, required by the Project, the substrate must be removed in orbit. In order to accomplish that, two possible methods are described in this paper. The first one is based on the UV degradation of a buffer layer located between the substrate and the metallic layers. The UV degradation would be the starting mechanism that causes the interface weakness. The Diamond Like Carbon has been used as buffer layer and preliminary experimental results on its UV degradation are reported. The second method exploits the characteristic of most plastics to be etched (ashing process) by the atomic oxygen. The number density of atomic oxygen in Low Earth Orbit could be enough to remove a properly-selected plastic substrate in Short time.}

The X2000 First Delivery Project supports missions to the Sun (to 4 solar radii), Europa (looking for a liquid ocean), Mars (in support of several Mars missions including a sample return), a comet (including a sample return), and Pluto followed by a trip into the Kuiper belt. This set of missions leads to some outstanding requirements: 1.1. Long-life (10–12 years)2.2. Total Ionizing Dose of 4 Mrad (for a Europa Orbiter)3.3. Average power consumption less than or equal to 150 Watts4.4.

The Roadmap is structured around a decadal progression of science missions and enabling technologies in which each decadal cycle has an intrinsic value in itself. The Roadmap serves at least 5 functions: 1) it lays the foundation for the development of a broad new strategic thrust of space exploration and development; 2) it outlines a long term progressive program for which each phase has an intrinsic value and can be argued independently of a Star Mission itself; 3) it defines a phased approach that would culminate in a large- scale breakthrough beamed energy capability that would have broad planetary and terrestrial applicability; 4) it describes an endeavor that could provide the technological basis of a U.S. economic engine for the first half of the 21st century; and 5) it provides a focus and a structure around which new government/industry economic relationships may be established. This paper outlines the process for constructing the Roadmap which is due to be completed in Fall 1998. It also poses questions raised by a mission of such scale and suggests some of the strategic value of such a Roadmap.}

abstract = {Launch weight and volume requirements are substantially decreased by reduction of probe size in exploration mission systems, as mass and volume both scale as the third power of system size. Accordingly, the already quite developed MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) technology, that offers low cost, small, light weight, and increasingly reliable devices through durability and redundancy, is strongly attractive as a near-term technology for significantly reducing the cost to launch and operate space systems. It is shown that the final goal of MEMS technology, i.e. the merging through solid state microdcvices of the functions of sensing, computation, communication and actuation, can lead to a new, biomimetic kind of miniature robotics, particularly suitable for planetary exploration, through molecular mono- electronics/MEMS integration jointly with a hyper-interspersed architecture made up of autonomous units embodying sensors, information processors and actuators. The problem tackled here concerns the basic design of such miniature robots, from some μm to insect size, featuring finely structured intelligent autonomous parts as smart skins, sensory and manipulating members working on the analogue external reality and communicating with their inner molecular level nondiscrete pseudo-analogue information processing networks. The (mesoscopic network)/MEMS units are shown to embody a quantum mechanical/macroscopic world connection, in which the nondiscrete molecular devices allow the automaton parts to perform very complex, fast information processing operations as metaphores of bionic functions like learning, attention, and decision making under uncertain conditions, this last due to the stochasticity inherent in the quantum network. Flexible architectures instead of von Neumann type rigid architectures in addition to hyper-interspersion of autonomous units can be realized through such nano/MEMS devices, and the μm — cm size of the whole robots and their organs allow dynamic biochemical, possibly reaction - diffusion, spatially separated highly nonlinear systems to be exploited as additional primitive computing devices (e.g. chemical oscillators, dissipative biomolecular distributed systems, planar photoactivated enzyme biosensors). Each interspersed unit can be designed as a multilevel nondiscrete system according to the information processing “rank” to be obtained in simulating the biological nervous system activity.}

Since 2007, within the first Open IE system TEXTRUNNER, other related works have been proposed in this area. Despite other secondary studies on Open IE, useful information available to initiate new research in the area is limited. Thus, we propose a review of the literature in Open IE by a systematic mapping study. We have retrieved 2484 articles about Open IE in Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus and Google Scholar databases. Among them, 2411 were filtered by exclusion criteria proposed in our systematic mapping protocol. The remaining 73 papers represent the state-of-the-art from the past seven years. Different researchers have proposed important contributions and have pointed out some open problems for Open IE. As a result, we summarized these contributions and identified significant gaps that could be envisioned as future works.}

abstract = {Reported herein are the first results of a NASA-sponsored study at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, exploring the scientific promise and technological viability of a mission to exploit the gravitational lensing effect of the Sun to obtain huge antenna gains for electromagnetic waves grazing the Sun's disk. With regard to scientific promise, these results, reported at about the halfway point of the study, substantiate the huge antenna gains offered by, as it will be called here, a Solar Gravitational Telescope (SGT) and point to the instrument's potential promise as a “discovery machine” but suggest considerable limitations to the telescope's usefulness as a general purpose astrophysical research tool. These limitations are seen to arise, primarily, from the geometry and scale of the “virtual” telescope which must be achieved and maintained to utilize the lensing effect and the turbulence effects of the Sun's plasma on the observed target's signal. With regard to technological viability, the preliminary results suggest a very aggressive use of unproven, as-yet-unflown new technology will be required to enable the desired science observations and mission durations approaching the short (3–10 year) NASA-targeted mission duration goal. Key needed new technologies are advanced propulsion, lightweight telescopes, membrane mirrors, inflatable/rigidizeable structures, and novel coronagraphic techniques.}

The limiting structural factor is usually the elastic stability of a number of elements subject to compressive loads.

The layout here proposed can be used for many types of sail, from tiny demonstration vehicles to large planetary sailers, provided that their trajectory does not get too close to the Sun, and for other large space structures. Its simplicity and low cost could allow to experiment with this type of spacecraft in a near future.}
