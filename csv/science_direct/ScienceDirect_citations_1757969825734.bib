abstract = {With the growing demand for precision agriculture, which requires high spatial and temporal resolution crop information, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral sensors have become increasingly vital tools for agricultural management due to their real-time monitoring capabilities, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. This paper provides a scoping review of advances in UAV-based multispectral remote sensing applications in precision agriculture, focusing on four key domains: crop growth monitoring, pest and disease identification, nutrient status assessment, and yield prediction. We offer a comprehensive analysis of the relevant literature, evaluating the principal challenges and opportunities associated with deploying this technology in the field. Our review indicates that traditional vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, GNDVI, SAVI) have achieved mature application across diverse crops. In contrast, integrating emerging indices (e.g., TCARI, RDVI, OSAVI) with intelligent algorithms can significantly enhance monitoring accuracy and operational efficiency. In addition, we recommend that future research prioritize improvements in algorithmic precision, optimizing the data-processing workflows, and interdisciplinary collaboration to promote deeper integration of UAV-based multispectral sensing and artificial intelligence methods. Finally, we outline several practical research directions to inform and guide subsequent investigations.}

abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in the flower industry focusing on the export business. The flower export sector is a very important industry for developing countries with considerable potential for improvement with Industry 4.0 technologies. Despite this potential, the deployment of these technologies encounters numerous barriers especially in emerging countries. This paper also studies the influence of these technologies on the productivity and sustainability of flower farms, including the entire process from planting to post-harvest management and distribution. We use a mixed-method strategy to accomplish these objectives: we performed a systematic literature review and carried out exploratory surveys administered to flower farmers in Ecuador and Colombia. The findings indicate that while the application of smart agricultural technologies in floriculture is currently restricted in emerging countries, there exists potential for its implementation. This research also points out obstacles for their adoption, including expenses, technical difficulties, and insufficient specialist. This research discusses the opportunities and problems associated with the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in floriculture by offering both theoretical and practical insights, while also giving recommendations for industry stakeholders in managing this transition.}
