India has emerged as the top country to grow potatoes after China, resulting in the maximum population relying on the income through potato production. For millions of individuals, potato is the primary source of nutrition. However. with the sudden changes in the weather conditions, the health of the potato leaves has been badly affected resulting in a decrease in crop production. These leaves are affected by bacteria and fungi, which are required to be tracked to reduce the losses in crop yield. In the proposed work, a convolutional neural network model has been utilized and implemented on the potato leaf disease data collected from Kaggle for predicting the presence of the disease. The categorization of leaf diseases provides an essential foundation for identifying and controlling the complex disease-causing agents impacting potato crops. This paper presents the model’s overall performance during training and validation with two different epochs 20 and 30. Accuracy and performance with loss assessments are also used and presented in the work. For epoch 20 during training, accuracy is 97.14% and a loss is 0.0864 has been identified. Similarly, accuracy and loss at epoch 30 are 98.43% and 0.0539, respectively. On the other hand, at epoch 20, the testing accuracy is 96.39%, whereas, the loss is 0.0842. After increasing the epoch count to 30, the testing accuracy of 97.60%, and the loss of 0.1077 have been resulted. These findings show that CNN is capable of correctly classifying potato leaf disease, paving the way for automated disease classification and higher agricultural yield.",,979-8-3503-7289-2,10.1109/NMITCON62075.2024.10699218,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10699218,Multi-class classification;potato leaf disease detection;convolutional neural network;deep learning;image processing,Training;Proteins;Accuracy;Production;Predictive models;Convolutional neural networks;Information technology;Diseases;Testing;Meteorology,,3,,28,IEEE,4 Oct 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

This study would close these gaps by producing a machine learning system that can help farmers with crop recommendations, fertiliser guidance, and plant disease detection. The algorithm considers micronutrients and organic matter in addition to NPK when recommending fertiliser.

The development of potato crop agriculture is very important for the sustainability of human life. There are several obstacles in developing potato farming, including a disease that attacks potato leaves which if left untreated will result in poor production or even crop failure in the future. One of the obstacles in the development of potato plants is the disease on potato leaves, namely early blight caused by the fungus Alternia solani, then late bligt disease caused by Microbe phytopthora infestans de bary. This disease has its respective symptoms so that farmers can take precautions if they see symptoms on potato leaves, but in this preventive step can only be done by experts who have knowledge in the field of diseases in potato plants while the average farmer does not have sufficient knowledge. So, the identification process becomes less accurate and takes a long time. Technology in the field of informatics in the form of digital image processing can be used to solve problems in disease identification in potato leaves, so this research will propose the right method for detecting disease in potato leaves. The identification process in this study uses three types of data in the form of healthy leaves, early blight, and late blight. The method used to identify is deep learning using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The result of this research is that the 70:30 data division produces better accuracy than the 80:20 data division. The accuracy obtained is 97% on training data and 92% on validation data using 20 batch sizes at 10 epochs.",,978-1-7281-7356-6,10.1109/ICOIACT50329.2020.9332037,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9332037,Potato diseases;late blight;early blight;identification;CNN,Training data;Production;Agriculture;Convolutional neural networks;Sustainable development;Diseases;Testing,,45,,9,IEEE,29 Jan 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Plant diseases are a huge problem in agriculture and incorporating machine learning algorithms for their early detection will help better yields and save the farmers from loses. This paper entails the use of such machine learning algorithms to detect leaf diseases in the cassava plant. Cassava is one of the largest sources of carbohydrates for the continent of Africa. It is also very vulnerable to several plant diseases; this in turn threatens the food security of the continent. The present study is based on four of such diseases that affect the cassava yield namely, Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), and Cassava Green Mottle (CGM). In this research work, EfficientNet-B0 is proposed for the early detection of these diseases. The EfficientNet-B0 models outperform existing CNNs in terms of accuracy and efficiency while reducing parameter size and FLOPS by an order of magnitude.

It has an influence not only on the economics of the country but also on global food grain statistics. Food security is a major challenge due to the rapidly increasing global people as well as the reducing trend in yields of crops. Obtaining sustainable crop production is always a problem for agriculturists. Due to ever-changing climatic circumstances, achieving optimal agricultural output has always been a problem for farmers. Land types, resource availability, and fluctuating climate patterns are the main causes of agricultural production uncertainty. Thus, researchers are developing tools that can predict crop production correctly and effectively in advance, allowing farmers worldwide to act accordingly in strategies to respond to obstacles. Agronomic strategies used by farmers at various phases of crop production and meteorological elements have a significant impact on crop production output [5]. The supply of nutrients directly impacts crops and the production of crops. Crops require a variety of nutrients, which are branched into two groups based on their requirements: macroeconomic nutrients and essential micronutrients. Phosphorous (P), Nitrogen (N), Calcium (Ca), Zinc (Zn), Potassium (K), Boron (B), Iron (Fe),Magnesium (Mg), Sulphur (S), and other nutrients are among them. Many micronutrients in the crops regulate biochemical processes, give resistance to diseases, and ultimately degrade crop quality. As a result, regulated nutrient management is critical for increasing crop production and achieving the essential rise in output.

Guava farms across various regions provide images of guava leaves, both healthy and diseased, to train a deep learning model for disease classification. The EfficientNet-B3 model, optimized with Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Transfer Learning, is used for accurate disease detection, including conditions like Anthracnose and Powdery Mildew. To ensure privacy, Federated Learning (FL) is employed, where the model is trained locally on edge devices such as smartphones and Jetson Nano devices situated at guava farms. These devices process the data locally and send model updates, rather than raw data, to a central server. This method enables the aggregation of knowledge from multiple farms without sharing sensitive information, thereby protecting farmers' data privacy. The use of Federated Learning allows the model to adapt to specific conditions at each farm, such as different diseases, leaf appearances, and lighting variations, improving its robustness and accuracy.

A mean average precision score of 95.90% by YOLOv7 suggests a robust fruit quality detection and localization system. The interconnected siamese layers extract shared features from inputs, enhancing joint learning. The visual weight prediction system exhibited a marginal root-mean-squared error rate of a mere 0.157. The origin of the fruits was identified with 98.33% accuracy. The bottleneck layer of SRCNN facilitated simultaneous regression and classification, capturing the hidden dynamics of source data and contributing well to a combined regression and classification model.

But some nutrient level in the soil is declining because of the usage of more fertilizers. Due to this, the crop production is falling. Hence, to increase the crop yield, the proposed methodology exploits all the soil micro and macronutrients of the soil to predict the crop suitability for a region. During the data categorization, beyond rough set, the fuzzy logic is used to handle the boundary values of the numerical features to improve the accuracy of the prediction. Rough set based rule induction method is used to generate the rules and the crop suitability is predicted according to the fuzzy rules. The results are benchmarked with algorithms like CN2, LEM2, AQ, and Indiscernibility. The discretized and fuzzified datasets are considered for experimental purposes. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated based on the different evaluation parameters like precision, recall, f1 score, and accuracy. The experimental results proved that fuzzy rules evolved by the LEM2 algorithm give higher prediction accuracy when compared to other algorithms for both the discretized and fuzzified datasets.",,978-1-7281-5518-0,10.1109/ICOEI48184.2020.9142899,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142899,Agriculture;Soil Nutrients;Crop suitability;Fuzzy logic,Soil;Fertilizers;Feature extraction;Rough sets;Fuzzy logic;Prediction algorithms,,12,,25,IEEE,17 Jul 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
AI Based IoT Framework for Soil Analysis and Fertilization Recommendation for Smart Coconut Farming,G. Lekshmi; P. Rekha,"Center for Wireless Networks & Applications (WNA), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, India; Center for Wireless Networks & Applications (WNA), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, India",2022 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication (ICSC),12 Jan 2023,2022,,,26,31,"India is identified as one of the top two farm producers in the world, and the agriculture sector plays a key role in the Indian economy. The major revenue of Kerala state is from coconut farming. Kerala is the top-ranked producer of coconut in India in terms of both area and production. It is observed that coconut farmers are going through a tough situation due to the decline of coconut production over time. They find it difficult to manage the crop efficiently. Proper irrigation and fertilization will help farmers improve the crop yield. In this paper, we have developed analytical models for predicting the fertilizer requirements based on the soil analysis and macronutrients present in the soil. This research work proposes an IoT framework for improving the yield of coconut production by effectively predicting fertilizer recommendations based on the crop’s current fertilization requirements, weather forecasts, and environmental conditions. Based on this analysis an efficient ML model is derived that helps in predicting fertilization requirements based on soil parameters. A model called Linear Regression is built to predict the amount of fertilizer needed using the values of soil parameters such as soil pH, potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, boron, zinc, soil carbon, manganese, and so on as input features. This model demonstrates promising performance with an accuracy of 93.5% in predicting the fertilizer and can be used by farmers as a tool for scientific farming for enhancing crop production.",2643-444X,978-1-6654-5430-8,10.1109/ICSC56524.2022.10009026,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10009026,IoT;EDA;Fertilizer Recommendation;Coconut farming;soil analysis;farming;agriculture;kerala,Irrigation;Analytical models;Crops;Production;Soil;Predictive models;Data models,,9,,20,IEEE,12 Jan 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
