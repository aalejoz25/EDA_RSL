All these features make it a healthy addition to a balanced diet. Apples come in a large range of colors, flavors, and varieties. There are several types of diseases both bacterial and fungal along with other types of nutritional and soil diseases that hamper the production of apple crops. A few common types of fungal diseases include Apple rot, rust, and scab. Timely identification and proper treatment can save apple crops in early stages of disease progression, saving the crop and not digging a hole in the pocket of the farmer. Until last century manual identification methods were more popular but they were very laborious, time-consuming, and the accuracy was not up to the mark. 21st century marks the use of machine learning and deep learning in almost all aspects of human life including early identification of disease in several plants including Apple. In this paper authors analyze and evaluate what are the current trends in detection of fungal diseases of Apple plants. Out of several types of Apple diseases three main types were chosen to conduct this review and those diseases are rust, scab, and rot. The primary aim of this review article is to analyze the use of various machine learning tools like CNN (convolutional neural network), support vector machine, and k nearest neighbor for the detection of fruit and leaf diseases under these three plant disease categories of Apple. An early detection will ensure early curative and remedial measures which will save the crop from getting destroyed due to the above diseases and will save the farmer from huge losses.","","979-8-3315-1859-2","10.1109/DELCON64804.2024.10866614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10866614","Apple Fungal Diseases;Machine Learning;Rust;Scab;Rot;Deep Learning","Support vector machines;Plant diseases;Reviews;Crops;Production;Soil;Optical fiber networks;Loss measurement;Convolutional neural networks;Diseases","","","","30","IEEE","11 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning technology has the potential to greatly improve agriculture by helping farmers make more educated decisions. However, current systems have considerable limitations. Many fertilizer recommendations only address the key nutrients NPK: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, fail to account for water availability, and rely on out-of-date historical data. This study would close these gaps by producing a machine learning system that can help farmers with crop recommendations, fertiliser guidance, and plant disease detection. The algorithm considers micronutrients and organic matter in addition to NPK when recommending fertiliser. It also incorporates water availability and real-time meteorological data to provide more precise crop suggestions, especially important for drought-prone areas. Deep learning methods analyze plant photos to detect diseases early on. Our findings indicate that by incorporating micro nutrients, water data, and real-time climate updates, the system can deliver more precise crop and fertilizer recommendations. The Random Forest and XGBoost models outperform, and the disease detection component helps to prevent crop losses by intervening early. The key takeaway from this study is that merging machine learning with large amounts of data can significantly improve farming techniques, raise crop yields, and provide farmers with reliable insights, thereby enhancing food security and sustainable agriculture.","","979-8-3315-1958-2","10.1109/ICDT63985.2025.10986310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10986310","Machine Learning;Crop and Fertilizer recommendation;Random Forest;XgBoost Model;Plant Disease Detection;Real time data","Deep learning;Plant diseases;Crops;Machine learning;Soil measurement;Nutrients;Real-time systems;Agriculture;Random forests;Fertilizers;Climate change","","","","20","IEEE","13 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper entails the use of such machine learning algorithms to detect leaf diseases in the cassava plant. Cassava is one of the largest sources of carbohydrates for the continent of Africa. It is also very vulnerable to several plant diseases; this in turn threatens the food security of the continent. The present study is based on four of such diseases that affect the cassava yield namely, Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), and Cassava Green Mottle (CGM). In this research work, EfficientNet-B0 is proposed for the early detection of these diseases. The EfficientNet-B0 models outperform existing CNNs in terms of accuracy and efficiency while reducing parameter size and FLOPS by an order of magnitude.

Sugarcane is no exception to the rule that plants are susceptible to disease. One problem with the sugar industry is that small-scale farmers lose revenue when sugarcane diseases aren’t identified and addressed in time to save the growing crops. A popular way for a farmer to discover and diagnose sugarcane illnesses is by visual inspection. Using this method on large farms becomes more laborious and time-consuming. The farmers and sugarcane business are both put at risk if it is not handled sooner. This inquiry was motivated by the ever-increasing types of ailments and the fact that farmers have limited abilities when it comes to diagnosing and identifying these diseases. A combination of Deep Learning (DL), Computer Vision (CV), and Machine Learning (ML) can solve this challenge. To boost agricultural output and efficiency, specialists have taken an interest in prompt disease identification and diagnosis. Losses may be avoided by employing ML and DL algorithms for early disease detection in sugarcane crops. The purpose of this research was to quickly and accurately extract diagnostic information from sugarcane using a variety of image processing and DL methods.

It helps keep crops healthy and makes farming last longer. Tomato leaf diseases are big problems for farmers and the farming business. Some of the key challenges associated with tomato leaf diseases include: Plant diseases in the leaves of tomato plants directly lead to a decrease in crop production. Diseases like early blight, late blight and bacterial wilt cause leaves to fall off too soon. This results in the plant's ability to grow fruit properly. Diseases in leaves can affect tomatoes by decreasing fruit production with weird shapes and marks. This not only makes the food look bad but can also result in people saying no to buying it and making its worth lower. In the proposed work, we proposed a strong ensemble model that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This helps to accurately identify ten different types of tomato leaf diseases using a learning rate of 0.015, our hybrid model gets an accuracy at 99.8%. The model's performance is shown more by a loss value of 0.032, showing how good it is at finding complicated patterns in the data set.

Various diseases, such as early blight, late blight, and others, will attack potato plants and manifest their symptoms in the leaves. If these outbreaks are discovered early and appropriate treatment is taken, the farmer will not suffer significant economic losses. In this article, the suggested computer vision deep learning approach would significantly help in early identification and detection of different potato disease. Many plant diseases have different visual characteristics that may be utilized to accurately identify and classify them. This study describes a potato disease classification method based on computer vision-deep learning combination. The system trains deep convolutional neural networks such as ResNet-152 and InceptionV3 on the Kaggle potato dataset with an accuracy of 98.34% and 95.24% respectively at learning rate of 0.0005.

However, mulberry trees are highly susceptible to diseases, spreading rapidly and causing significant losses. Manual disease identification across large farms is arduous and time-consuming. Leveraging computer vision for early disease detection and classification can mitigate up to 90% of production losses. This study collected leaves from two regions of Bangladesh, categorized as healthy, leaf rust-affected, and leaf spot-affected. With a total of 1091 images, split into training (764), testing (218), and validation (109) sets for 5-fold cross-validation, preprocessing and augmentation yielded 6,000 images, including synthetics. This study compares ResNet50, VGG19, and MobileNetV3Small on a specific task following architecture modifications. Four convolutional layers with different output channels (512, 128, 64, and 32) were added to baseline models. We assessed how these architectural changes affected model correctness, computing efficiency, and convergence rates. Comparing three pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - MobileNetV3Small, ResNet50, and VGG19 - augmented with four additional layers, the modified MobileNetV3Small excelled in precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, achieving notable results of 97.0%, 96.4%, 96.4%, and 96.4%, respectively, across cross-validation folds. An efficient smartphone application employing the proposed model for mulberry leaf disease recognition was developed. Overall, the model outperformed existing State of the Art (SOTA) approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in disease identification.

Tomato plants are unfortunately prone to a number of illnesses, which can result in decreased production and quality and substantial financial losses. Grey leaf spot is one of the most prevalent diseases affecting tomato plants. It damages and destroys the leaves, which eventually prevents the plant from bearing fruit. Contact, invasion, latency, and onset are the four stages of the infection that the pathogen that causes grey leaf spot in tomato plants goes through. Early illness detection can provide effective management strategies and potentially avert widespread pandemics. Solanum lycopersicum, often known as the South Indian tomato, is a widely used vegetable in cooking. The tomato plant is widely cultivated and regarded as a significant agricultural commodity due to its ability to adapt to a range of environmental conditions and its abundance in potassium, vitamins C and K, and other minerals. However, growing tomatoes is not without its difficulties. Leaf diseases, which can reduce yields by as much as 60%, are one major challenge. The likelihood that conventional detection methods won't be able to keep up with the quick trends in plant diseases underscores the urgent need for creative alternatives.

The traditional approach of detecting leaf diseases in fruit plants requires farmers to undertake manual inspection which exhibits a lack of reliability and consistency. Moreover, the manual inspection procedure is prone to errors due to its reliance on the farmer’s knowledge and skill. Mango referred to as the ""king of all fruits"", is renowned for its rich composition of various vitamins and vital nutrients. Mangoes are susceptible to many diseases that adversely damage their visual appeal, and flavor, and have significant implications on the overall economy. The identification of diseases affecting mango plant leaves using automated recognition remains a challenge due to the diverse range of symptoms and limited availability of data. There have been several deep learning-based research studies focused on identifying diseases in mango leaves; however, the majority of these studies have employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a small number of data. This study presents a Vision Transformer (ViT) based approach to detect diseases in mango leaves using publicly available data namely MangoLeafBD. The ViT model has been selected as the detection model due to its parameter efficiency compared to deep CNN models. The ViT has produced remarkable overall classification accuracy of 100%, precision of 100%, recall of 100%, and f1-score of 100% for disease detection on mango leaves which is better than the existing CNN approaches on the MangoLeafBD dataset.

Cassava is loaded with carbohydrates and is mostly cultivated by small farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa as a security crop as it is capable of growing amidst drought which affects mostly all the other crops directly and adversely. At present, farmers are completely dependent on plant health experts to come and have a weekly or bi-weekly random inspection of the plants. They collect leaf samples from 3 different parts of the plant – top, middle, and lower parts and send them to the lab for testing. This takes up a lot of time and does not leave enough time for farmers to find a solution once the plants get affected. Therefore, it is important for farmers to detect the diseases as early as possible. To tackle this problem, we propose a disease detection model for cassava plants using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The features in the cassava plant images which signify the presence of disease will be automatically learned by the Neural Network. The farmers cannot detect these features manually. This research was conducted using a dataset of 21,397 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda comprising four diseases namely Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Green Mottle (CGM), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and the dataset also contains healthy images of the plant. Most of the images in this dataset were taken by farmers in their gardens to provide a realistic representation of how farmers would diagnose these diseases in real life. These images were annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala.","","978-1-6654-7224-1","10.1109/CCiCT56684.2022.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9913520","Automation;Cassava disease recognition;Disease Identification;Deep Learning;Transfer Learning;Farmers;Survey;Image classification;DenseNet;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","Microorganisms;Computational modeling;Plants (biology);Neural networks;Crops;Inspection;Convolutional neural networks","","11","","10","IEEE","12 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To suggest a CNN model using federated learning to analyse data from several clients while preserving privacy for a quick and precise diagnosis. The method analyses the severity of the five stages of beetroot leaf diseases using a federated learning technique across several local clients to use precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy as performance measurements. The review showed that performance had improved consistently for all customers. As an example, Client X had a prediction accuracy of 0.97, which increased gradually to 0.98 for both Client P and Client R. Additionally, as shown by the macro-average (94.15-94.17%), weighted average (94.67%), and micro-average (94.62%) scores for top-performing customers, the model's performance remained stable and resilient throughout all severity levels. The study's findings support using a CNN model built on federated learning for scalable, effective, and privacy-preserving disease control in agriculture. The promising results suggest the potential for extending such approaches to other agricultural products, considerably advancing efforts to ensure global food security. The research also showed that the CNN model could learn and develop continuously in a federated learning scenario, highlighting its usefulness as a dynamic tool that adapts to new illness patterns. A paradigm shift in the approach to combating agricultural illnesses and increasing food supply is heralded by this study, which reveals a potential junction between machine learning and agricultural disease management. The findings motivate more research into the model's adaptability to other crops and pests, enhancing its contribution to resilient and sustainable farming systems.","","979-8-3503-0088-8","10.1109/ICOSEC58147.2023.10276191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10276191","Beetroot leaf diseases;Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);Federated learning;Disease classification;Severity levels","Productivity;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Sensitivity;Federated learning;Crops;Predictive models","","3","","16","IEEE","16 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increase in world population, the fruit demand has also increased. However, there are various diseases which affect the health of the grapevine leading to loss in its production. In the present study, a pre-trained and fine-tuned VGG16 model has been implemented for precise and accurate grape leaf disease identification. It is crucial to determine the health and growth of grapevines, but the use of advanced computer vision methods can speed up this process. The VGG16 model extracts deep features from the images and allows a faster and non-invasive performance evaluation. In the proposed work, the significance of grape leaf disease detection in viticulture is examined. The study implements the fine-tuned VGG16 model on a Kaggle-based dataset and examines the performance outcomes. The model’s performance results have been identified in terms of accuracy and loss on different numbers of epochs. The results show that with the increase in the epoch count, the accuracy has also increased and reached 98% at epoch 25. The proposed VGG16 model for grape leaf disease recognition is a significant step forward for the viticulture sector, offering a potential approach for automating the evaluation of grape plant health. The proposed work also discusses about the training and testing loss and results that at epoch count 25, the lowest training and testing loss of 0.1466, and 0.1051 have been identified. These findings demonstrate the VGG16 model’s effectiveness in identifying grape leaf diseases by demonstrating its precision and potential to improve both the effectiveness and quality of grapevine management.","","979-8-3503-8793-3","10.1109/IC457434.2024.10486737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10486737","Deep learning;precision agriculture;VGG16;grapevine diseases;grapes leaf disease","Training;Computational modeling;Pipelines;Sociology;Production;Feature extraction;Loss measurement","","9","","24","IEEE","4 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
