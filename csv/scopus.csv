Although AMPs have limited applications in agriculture, their potential to replace chemical pesticides could address food security and environmental concerns. Members of Bacillus sp., abundant in soil and plant microbiomes, are recognized as important sources of AMPs for their resistance and strong antimicrobial properties, making them ideal candidates for biocontrol in sustainable agriculture. To harness this potential, this study employed deep learning models to predict AMPs derived from Bacillus genomes, aiming to identify candidates with high activity against phytopathogens. Subsequently, the antimicrobial efficacy of selected candidate AMPs was experimentally validated. Results: More than 6700 Bacillus genomes were collected to identify a broad range of short peptides (10–100 amino acids), which were analyzed using advanced deep learning models, including BERT, Mamba, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Attention. These models demonstrated enhanced predictive accuracy and reliability over existing methods, and resulted in 4,993,389 potential AMPs from Bacillus genomes. Among these AMPs, two high-confidence AMPs (cAMP_1 and cAMP_2) were selected by cross-validation, and their structural stability and activity were evaluated and verified by molecular dynamics simulations and experimental assays, respectively. Both of them exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and various common agricultural fungal and bacterial pathogens. Conclusions: This high-throughput deep learning pipeline successfully uncovered novel AMPs from Bacillus genomes, which underscored the efficiency of deep learning models in identifying functional peptides. This approach could accelerate the discovery of potential AMPs for biocontrol applications in plant disease management, contributing to sustainable agriculture and reduced dependency on traditional antibiotics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Antimicrobial Peptides; Bacillus; Deep Learning; Functional Peptide Prediction; High-throughput Screening; Plant Disease Control,,,,This work was supported by the Beijing Life Science Academy [BLSA: 2023000CC0110; 2024200CC0130; 2023000CB0040]; Natural Science Foundation of Henan (232300420220); the Innovation project of Henan Academy of Sciences (453); Zhengzhou Tobacco Research Institute [110202201003(JY-03)].,"Iralu, Nulevino, Antimicrobial peptides from plants and microorganisms for plant disease management, Plant Pathology, 73, 7, pp. 1691-1707, (2024); Li, Shuo, Natural antimicrobials from plants: Recent advances and future prospects, Food Chemistry, 432, (2024); Huang, Chien Yu, A stable antimicrobial peptide with dual functions of treating and preventing citrus Huanglongbing, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 6, (2021); Tavormina, Patrizia, The plant peptidome: An expanding repertoire of structural features and biological functions, Plant Cell, 27, 8, pp. 2095-2118, (2015); Kumar, Sumit, Unraveling the role of antimicrobial peptides in plant resistance against phytopathogens, Discover Sustainability, 5, 1, (2024); Zou, Fanglei, Plant antimicrobial peptides: a comprehensive review of their classification, production, mode of action, functions, applications, and challenges, Food and Function, 14, 12, pp. 5492-5515, (2023); Slezina, Marina P., Plant Antimicrobial Peptides: Insights into Structure-Function Relationships for Practical Applications, Current Issues in Molecular Biology, 45, 4, pp. 3674-3704, (2023); Li, Junpeng, Plant antimicrobial peptides: structures, functions, and applications, Botanical Studies, 62, 1, (2021); MacNair, Craig R., Alternative therapeutic strategies to treat antibiotic-resistant pathogens, Nature Reviews Microbiology, 22, 5, pp. 262-275, (2024); Li, Tianxi, Activity and mechanism of action of antifungal peptides from microorganisms: A review, Molecules, 26, 11, (2021)",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,21965641,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000726174

This study characterized a cacao collection (173 accessions) evaluated in Puerto Rico, examining phenotypic diversity, trait interrelationships, and performing comparative analyses with published Trinidad and Colombia datasets. We also developed machine learning (ML) models for yield prediction and identified yield-associated SNP markers. Results: The cacao collection showed significant phenotypic variation and strong intra-collection trait correlations. Comparative analyses revealed conserved trait responses across environments, notably linking susceptibility to black pod rot in Puerto Rico with Witches' Broom Disease in Colombia, suggesting a broad-spectrum disease response mechanism. Machine learning models effectively modeled yield, quantifying a hierarchy of predictor importance, with ‘Total pods’, ‘Infection rate’, and ‘Pod weight’ being the most influential. Integrating existing SNP data for 28 common accessions, multiple SNPs were identified as significantly associated with key horticultural traits, including ‘Total pods’, ‘Infection rate’, and ‘Yield’ (FDR < 0.01). Notably, a single genetic marker on chromosome 5 (TcSNP475), located within a putative zinc finger stress-associated protein gene (Tc05_t008610), was associated with both ‘Total pods’ and ‘Yield’, representing a prime target for marker-assisted selection. Conclusions: This research provides a detailed characterization of a wide germplasm collection, robust yield predictors, and a suite of novel trait-linked genetic markers, offering valuable resources for cacao breeding. These integrated findings will provide a solid foundation for targeted breeding strategies and deeper molecular investigations into the mechanisms underpinning yield and stress resilience in this vital global crop. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cacao; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Machine Learning; Microbiology; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plant Disease; Puerto Rico; Quantitative Trait Locus; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Cacao; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci","cacao; genetics; growth, development and aging; machine learning; microbiology; phenotype; plant breeding; plant disease; Puerto Rico; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; Cacao; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci",,,"This work is supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, In-House Projects No. 8042-21220-258-000-D and 8042-21000-303-000-D.

This study combines Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and machine learning (ML) to specific macronutrients, namely nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg), in fig leaves (Ficus carica L.). A dataset of 90 leaves was analyzed, with FTIR spectra (450–4000 cm⁻1) preprocessed via baseline correction and second-derivative transformations. Three ML models were evaluated using fivefold cross-validation including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting (GB), with performance assessed via root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). GB outperformed other models, achieving validation RMSE/RPD values of 0.133/1.60 (nitrogen, N), 0.0107/1.79 (phosphorus, P), 0.1328/1.65 (potassium, K), 0.0636/1.96 (magnesium, Mg), and 0.2657/1.60 (calcium, Ca). Predictions for Mg (validation R2 = 0.7351) and P (validation R2 = 0.6873) exhibited the highest accuracy, potentially attributed to their stronger or more distinct spectral features (e.g., Mg-O stretching around 1050– 1150 cm⁻1; P-O vibrations around 1240 cm⁻1). Cross-validation revealed robust generalization for GB; while mean training RMSE was very low (< 0.01 for P and Mg), validation RMSE remained relatively low, underscoring the model’s utility for screening (RPD > 1.5). Despite evidence of overfitting (training R2 ≈ 0.999 vs. validation R2 = 0.61–0.74), GB’s performance evaluated using both RMSE and RPD confirmed its superiority over RF and SVR, which showed higher errors (e.g., SVR for Ca: RMSE = 0.4574, RPD = 1.07). This study demonstrates that FTIR-ATR coupled with ML is a rapid, non-destructive alternative to conventional destructive chemical analysis and that GB’s reliability, as indicated by RPD values > 1.5, offers actionable insights for precision nutrient management in sustainable agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fig Leaves; Ftir-atr Spectroscopy; Gradient Boosting; Machine Learning; Mineral Prediction; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Agricultural Machinery; Agriculture; Forecasting; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Mean Square Error; Nitrogen; Personnel Training; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Supersaturation; Attenuated Total Reflectance Spectroscopy; Fig Leaves; Fourier Transform Infrared; Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy With Attenuated Total Reflectance Spectroscopy; Gradient Boosting; Machine-learning; Mineral Prediction; Performance; Root Mean Square Errors; Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Chemistry; Ficus; Machine Learning; Nutrient; Plant Leaf; Machine Learning; Nutrients; Plant Leaves; Potassium; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mean square error; Nitrogen; Personnel training; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Supersaturation; Attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy; Fig leaves; Fourier transform infrared; Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy; Gradient boosting; Machine-learning; Mineral prediction; Performance; Root mean square errors; Transform infrared spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; chemistry; Ficus; machine learning; nutrient; plant leaf; Machine Learning; Nutrients; Plant Leaves; Potassium; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium","This project was supported by the MCRDV initiative through the project titled 'Adaptation du figuier aux changements climatiques : Optimisation de la nutrition hydromin\u00E9rale et pr\u00E9diction des aires de distribution future de la culture,' funded by the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development and Water and Forests.","Ågren, Göran I., Plant stoichiometry at different scales: Element concentration patterns reflect environment more than genotype, New Phytologist, 194, 4, pp. 944-952, (2012); A I P Conf Proc, (1991); Bureau, Sylvie M., Application of ATR-FTIR for a rapid and simultaneous determination of sugars and organic acids in apricot fruit, Food Chemistry, 115, 3, pp. 1133-1140, (2009); Carballo-Meilan, M.

Bazila, Department of Computer Science and Business Systems, KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, India","Identifying diseases from images of plant leaves is one of the most important research topics in the field of agriculture. Cassava is a rich plant in protein and vitamins, particularly in the leaves, and it is also employed as a substitute for rice. Since, the leaf is the most susceptible portion of a plant, it is said to be affected easily in comparison with the other parts. Therefore, the detection of plant leaf diseases may decrease the possibility that the plant will undergo additional damage. Many research works have been designed for Cassava plant leaf disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of leaf disease detection was not improved with the minimum amount of error and time. In this paper, a novel technique called Gaussian Regressed Generative Adversarial Networks based Hermitian Extreme Gradient Boosting (GRGAN-HEGB) is introduced for accurate cassava plant disease detection. The GRGAN-HEGB technique is composed of three parts: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. At first, the numbers of real cassava leaf images are collected from the Cassava Disease Classification dataset. Then, the collected cassava leaf images are preprocessed using the Gaussian Process Regressed Generative Adversarial Network (GPR-GAN) model. Feature extraction is performed by employing Continuous Hermitian Contingency Correlation (CH-CC) model to extract the most influential features such as texture, shape, and colour for disease pattern detection. Lastly, the Cophenetic Optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting classification process is performed to classify the input cassava leaf images with extracted features. As a result, the accuracy of leaf disease detection is improved with a short processing time. Experimental evaluation is carried out using the cassava disease classification dataset by considering different metrics such as disease detection accuracy, disease detection time, precision, and recall. The statistical results confirm that the proposed technique achieves higher accuracy by 12 %, precision by 2 %, and recall by 2 % with minimum disease detection processing time by 10 % than the conventional classification methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cassava Plant Leaf Disease Diagnosis; Continuous Hermitian Contingency Correlation; Cophenetic Optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting; Gaussian Process Regressed Generative Adversarial Networks; Plant Leaves; Adversarial Networks; Cassavum Plant Leaf Disease Diagnose; Continuous Hermitian Contingency Correlation; Cophenetic Optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting; Disease Diagnosis; Gaussian Process Regressed Generative Adversarial Network; Gaussian Processes; Gradient Boosting; Hermitians; Leaf Disease; Plant Leaves; Article; Cassava; Color; Controlled Study; Disease Classification; Feature Extraction; Generative Adversarial Network; Image Processing; Measurement Accuracy; Nonhuman; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Texture Analysis; Time,Adversarial networks; Cassavum plant leaf disease diagnose; Continuous hermitian contingency correlation; Cophenetic optimized extreme gradient boosting; Disease diagnosis; Gaussian process regressed generative adversarial network; Gaussian Processes; Gradient boosting; Hermitians; Leaf disease; Plant leaves; Article; cassava; color; controlled study; disease classification; feature extraction; generative adversarial network; image processing; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; plant disease; plant leaf; texture analysis; time,,,,"Roy, Kyamelia, Detection of Tomato Leaf Diseases for Agro-Based Industries Using Novel PCA DeepNet, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 14983-15001, (2023); Alshammari, Hamoud H., Identification of olive leaf disease through optimized deep learning approach, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 72, pp. 213-224, (2023); Vishnoi, Vibhor Kumar, Detection of Apple Plant Diseases Using Leaf Images Through Convolutional Neural Network, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 6594-6609, (2023); Lilhore, Umesh Kumar, Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network Model for Cassava Leaf Disease Identification and Classification, Mathematics, 10, 4, (2022); Liu, Mingxin, Research on cassava disease classification using the multi-scale fusion model based on EfficientNet and attention mechanism, Frontiers in Plant Science, 13, (2022); Zhao, Shengyi, Tomato leaf disease diagnosis based on improved convolution neural network by attention module, Agriculture (Switzerland), 11, 7, (2021); Wu, Yang, Plant Leaf Diseases Fine-Grained Categorization Using Convolutional Neural Networks, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 41087-41096, (2022); Ullah, Naeem, An Efficient Approach for Crops Pests Recognition and Classification Based on Novel DeepPestNet Deep Learning Model, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 73019-73032, (2022); Ahmed, Sabbir, Less is More: Lighter and Faster Deep Neural Architecture for Tomato Leaf Disease Classification, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 68868-68884, (2022); Elfatimi, Elhoucine, Beans Leaf Diseases Classification Using MobileNet Models, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 9471-9482, (2022)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,17468108; 17468094,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000145242

Abstract: Plant breeding has traditionally relied on phenotyping to select individuals with desirable traits—a process that is both costly and time-consuming. Increasingly, breeding strategies are shifting toward precision breeding, where causal variants are directly targeted based on their effects. To predict the effects of causal variants, in silico methods are emerging as efficient alternatives or complements to mutagenesis screens. Here, we review state-of-the-art machine learning methods for predicting variant effects in plants across both coding and noncoding regions, contrasting supervised approaches in functional genomics with unsupervised methods in comparative genomics. We discuss challenges in validating predictions, and compare these methods with traditional association and comparative genomics techniques. We argue that modern sequence models extend traditional methods by generalizing across genomic contexts, fitting a unified model across loci rather than a separate model for each locus. In doing so, they address inherent limitations of traditional quantitative and evolutionary comparative genetics techniques. However, the accuracy and generalizability of sequence models heavily depend on the training data, highlighting the need for validation experiments. We point to successful applications of sequence models, especially with protein sequences, and identify areas for further improvement, especially in modeling regulatory sequences. While not yet mature for in silico-driven precision breeding, sequence models show strong potential to become an integral part of the breeder’s toolbox. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genes; Learning Systems; Molecular Biology; Personnel Training; Plant Diseases; Plants (botany); Prediction Models; Comparative Genomics; High Resolution; In-silico; Key Message; Message Sequences; Plant Breeding; Rigorous Validation; Sequence Models; Silico Prediction; Validation Study; Forecasting; Biological Model; Computer Simulation; Genetic Variation; Genetics; Genomics; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plant; Plant Breeding; Plant Genome; Procedures; Computer Simulation; Genetic Variation; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Machine Learning; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plants","Genes; Learning systems; Molecular biology; Personnel training; Plant diseases; Plants (botany); Prediction models; Comparative genomics; High resolution; In-silico; Key message; Message sequences; Plant breeding; Rigorous validation; Sequence models; Silico prediction; Validation study; Forecasting; biological model; computer simulation; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; machine learning; phenotype; plant; plant breeding; plant genome; procedures; Computer Simulation; Genetic Variation; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Machine Learning; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plants",,,"This research is supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, Grant NNF21OC0067311.","Agarwal, Vikram, Predicting mRNA Abundance Directly from Genomic Sequence Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, Cell Reports, 31, 7, (2020); Alley, Ethan C., Unified rational protein engineering with sequence-based deep representation learning, Nature Methods, 16, 12, pp. 1315-1322, (2019); Angermueller, Christof, Deep learning for computational biology, Molecular Systems Biology, 12, 7, (2016); Avsec, Žiga, Effective gene expression prediction from sequence by integrating long-range interactions, Nature Methods, 18, 10, pp. 1196-1203, (2021); Avsec, Žiga, Base-resolution models of transcription-factor binding reveal soft motif syntax, Nature Genetics, 53, 3, pp. 354-366, (2021); Baek, Minkyung, Accurate prediction of protein structures and interactions using a three-track neural network, Science, 373, 6557, pp. 871-876, (2021); Cross Validation What does It Estimate and how Well does It do It, (2021); Bayer, Philipp E., Plant pan-genomes are the new reference, Nature Plants, 6, 8, pp. 914-920, (2020); Benegas, Gonzalo, DNA language models are powerful predictors of genome-wide variant effects, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 120, 44, (2023); Benegas, Gonzalo, A DNA language model based on multispecies alignment predicts the effects of genome-wide variants, Nature Biotechnology, (2025)",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,00405752; 14322242,,THAGA,40719915,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011994604

Identifying PPIs in plant-pathogen interactions is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant defense and pathogen virulence. However, experimental methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, prompting the use of computational techniques to complement traditional approaches. A robust ensemble model was developed using multiple sequence encodings and diverse learning algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network. The features used included auto-covariance, conjoint triad, and local descriptor schemes, which were selected based on their performance. The top three performing models were combined into an ensemble model, improving prediction accuracy to approximately 97%. The PlantPathoPPI tool, developed through this approach, was compared with existing tools using an independent test dataset, showing promising potential for PPI prediction in plant-pathogen interactions. To facilitate broad accessibility, a web-based prediction server was developed, available at https://plantpathoppi.onrender.com/, alongside a Python package on https://pypi.org/project/plantpathoppi-ml/. This research contributes significantly to the field by offering an efficient tool for predicting PPIs in plant-pathogen systems, providing valuable insights into plant diseases and supporting hypothesis-driven research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ensemble Model; Machine Learning; Plant-pathogen Interactions; Plantpathoppi; Protein-protein Interactions; Plant Proteins; Intersppi; Python V3.9; Virush- Ostppi; Amino Acid Composition; Amino Acid Sequence; Architecture; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Chemical Composition; Conjoint Triad; Controlled Study; Correlation Coefficient; Dipeptide Composition; Distribution Parameters; Extraction; Grouped Amino Acid Composition; Grouped Dipeptide Composition; Grouped Tripeptide Composition; Infectious Agent; Learning Algorithm; Local Descriptor; Machine Learning; Mathematical Analysis; Measurement Accuracy; Methodology; Nonhuman; Phytopathogen; Plant Defense; Plant Disease; Plant Pathogen Interaction; Prediction; Protein Protein Interaction; Random Forest; Software; Support Vector Machine; Tripeptide Composition; Web Server; Algorithm; Bioinformatics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant; Procedures; Protein Analysis; Plant Protein; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Host-pathogen Interactions; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Plants; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Software; Support Vector Machine","amino acid composition; amino acid sequence; architecture; Article; artificial neural network; chemical composition; conjoint triad; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dipeptide composition; distribution parameters; extraction; grouped amino acid composition; grouped dipeptide composition; grouped tripeptide composition; infectious agent; learning algorithm; local descriptor; machine learning; mathematical analysis; measurement accuracy; methodology; nonhuman; phytopathogen; plant defense; plant disease; plant pathogen interaction; prediction; protein protein interaction; random forest; software; support vector machine; tripeptide composition; web server; algorithm; bioinformatics; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; microbiology; plant; procedures; protein analysis; plant protein; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Plants; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Software; Support Vector Machine",,Plant Proteins,"Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the facilities provided by ICAR-Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute, ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources and ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute.

Spinach, abundant in iron, vitamins, and other essential nutrients, plays a vital role in maintaining the health of human tissues, cartilage, and hair. However, extreme summer heat and plant diseases can significantly reduce spinach yields, making it less nutritious and harder to obtain. Implementing improved detection and classification of bacterial and fungal diseases affecting spinach leaves is crucial for minimizing pesticide use and enhancing agricultural output. A cutting-edge approach was introduced for identifying diseases in spinach leaves through deep learning object detection. To tackle these issues, the DenseNet-121-DO model served as the basis for developing the Custom Monochromatic LeafAdaptNet (MLAN). Spinach leaves were classified as Half-Spinach, Curry Leaves, Drumstick Leaves, and Lettuce, with the aid of Google-Colaboratory. This model displayed impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 99.10% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 98.16%.

Abstract: Grain legumes, such as soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) play an important role in combating micronutrient malnutrition in the growing human population. However, plant diseases significantly reduce grain yield, causing 10–40% losses in major food crops. The genetic mechanisms associated with disease resistance in legumes have been widely studied using genomic approaches. Multi-omics data encompassing various biological layers such as the transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, and metabolome, in addition to the genome, enables researchers to gain a deeper understanding of these complementary layers and their roles in complex legume-pathogen interactions. Genomic prediction, used to select the best genotypes with desirable traits for breeding, has largely relied on genome-wide markers and statistical approaches to estimate the breeding values of individuals. Integrating multi-omics data into genomic prediction can be achieved using machine learning models, which can capture nonlinear relationships prevalent in high-dimensional data better than traditional statistical methods. This integration may enable more accurate predictions and identification of resistance mechanisms for breeding resistant legumes. Despite its potential, multi-omics integration for disease resistance prediction in legumes has been largely unexplored. In this review, we explore omics studies focusing on disease resistance in legumes and discuss how machine learning models can integrate multi-omics data for disease resistance prediction. Such multi-omics assisted prediction has the potential to reduce the breeding cycle for developing disease-resistant legume varieties. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crops; Cultivation; Diseases; Genes; Integration; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Plant Diseases; Plants (botany); Statistical Methods; 'omics'; Chickpea (cicer Arietinum L.); Disease Resistance; Genomic Predictions; Grain Legume; Key Message; Machine Learning Models; Machine-learning; Resistance Mechanisms; Soybean [glycine Max (l.)

Consumed all around the globe due to it being rich in nutrients such as vitamins, antioxidants, and for being high in fibre. These are nutritional qualities that help with digestion, immune-system, and minimizing inflammation. It is a common issue among farmers to have to deal with various diseases in cauliflower leaves that are difficult to diagnose in their early stages. These diseases have a tendency to propagate in a really swift pace throughout entire fields worth of crops. This in-turn causes heavy losses in the harvest, and makes it much more tedious and resource-intensive to protect the crops. As a result, farmers get more likely to use high amounts of pesticides and harmful chemicals to streamline the process of getting a more reliable yield on their crops. This is not only costly, but it is also harmful both to the quality of crops and to the well-being of the environment. In this publication, we are introducing a dataset containing a considerable number of images of cauliflower leaves. This is intended to drive development on this topic at a faster pace than it is now, and to help enhance disease monitoring, diagnosis, and precautionary techniques. We collected our dataset images between November 2024 and January 2025. In this dataset, cauliflower leaves were categorized into three classes: Healthy, Insect Holes, and Black Rot, each reflecting a specific condition that impacts plant health at different stages. This dataset consists of 2,661 images. The pictures were captured at different locations in Bangladesh, under different weather conditions, dates, temperatures, and with different devices. To enhance the data quality, we used several steps to process the dataset, making sure it would reflect real-world conditions and be ready for training. The images were resized to a standard size of 3000 × 3000 pixels, brightness was adjusted to make the images more easily discernible, and we removed duplicates and poor-quality images. These actions helped ensure the dataset was in the best possible shape for effective model training. This dataset will be highly effective for agricultural research, precision agriculture, and effective management of diseases. It should help develop highly accurate machine learning models for early detection of Cauliflower leaf diseases. The dataset is employed to train deep learning models to support automated monitoring and smart decision-making in precision agriculture. This data set also has immense potential for real-time and practical use. It can be utilized to develop applications like mobile apps or automated systems where farmers can easily identify diseases at early stages and take immediate action, without the requirement of expert on-site knowledge. This data set can also be utilized with smart farming equipment like drones and sensors to track big fields in real time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Dataset; Cauliflower Leaf Disease; Deep Learning; Disease Detection; Image Dataset; Crop Protection; Fertilizers; Insect Control; Vegetables; Agricultural Dataset; Cauliflower Leaf Disease; Cauliflower Leaves; Condition; Data Set; Deep Learning; Disease Detection; Image Datasets; Leaf Disease; Precision Agriculture; Pesticides,Crop protection; Fertilizers; Insect control; Vegetables; Agricultural dataset; Cauliflower leaf disease; Cauliflower leaves; Condition; Data set; Deep learning; Disease detection; Image datasets; Leaf disease; Precision Agriculture; Pesticides,,,"We sincerely thank Professor Dr. M.

The modeling results indicated that doubling the nitrate concentration, combined with a 2.2% increase in potassium and a 5.3% increase in phosphorus compared to the half-strength MS medium, yielded the most favorable morphological traits. Additionally, the model demonstrated that a twofold increase in nitrate, along with a 2.7% increase in potassium and a 4.7% increase in phosphorus, significantly improved biochemical characteristics, including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids. To investigate the possibility of introducing a single optimal point for the improvement of both morphological and biochemical traits, new plants were cultivated by doubling the nitrate content, a 2.5% increase in potassium, and a 5.0% increase in phosphorus, all compared with the control, i.e., half-strength MS medium. Remarkable enhancements were observed in plant physiology and biochemistry, achieving over a 50% increase in morphological traits and a 200% increase in biochemical traits. The proposed approach that effectively reduces the growth period of the orchid plantlets, can revolutionize the cultivation of plants with prolonged growth periods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Networks; Plant Biochemistry; Plant Morphology; Abiotic; Anthropogenic; Biotic; Biochemical Traits; Growth Period; In-vitro; Machine-learning; Morphological Traits; Neural-networks; Phalaenopsis Orchids; Plant Biochemistry; Plant Morphology; Plantlets; Plant Diseases; Anatomy; Biochemistry; Cultivation; Growth; Increments; Phosphorus; Plants; Potassium,Abiotic; Anthropogenic; Biotic; Biochemical traits; Growth period; In-vitro; Machine-learning; Morphological traits; Neural-networks; Phalaenopsis orchids; Plant biochemistry; Plant morphology; Plantlets; Plant diseases; Anatomy; Biochemistry; Cultivation; Growth; Increments; Phosphorus; Plants; Potassium,,,Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) for their support under project No. 4013866.; Funding text 2: Iran National Science Foundation (Grant no. 4013866).,"Alanagh, Esmaeil Nezami, Design of tissue culture media for efficient Prunus rootstock micropropagation using artificial intelligence models, Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture, 117, 3, pp. 349-359, (2014); Anuchai, Jatuporn, Effect of change in light quality on physiological transformation of in vitro phalaenopsis ‘fortune saltzman’ seedlings during the growth period, Horticulture Journal, 86, 3, pp. 395-402, (2017); Arab, Mohammad Mehdi, Artificial neural network genetic algorithm as powerful tool to predict and optimize in vitro proliferation mineral medium for G × N15 rootstock, Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, OCTOBER2016, (2016); Arab, Mohammad Mehdi, Modeling and Optimizing a New Culture Medium for in Vitro Rooting of G×N15 Prunus Rootstock using Artificial Neural Network-Genetic Algorithm, Scientific Reports, 8, 1, (2018); Micropropagation of Orchids, (1993); Ashraf, Muhammad, Photosynthesis under stressful environments: An overview, Photosynthetica, 51, 2, pp. 163-190, (2013); Baslam, Marouane, Recent advances in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in C3 plants, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 22, 1, pp. 1-39, (2021); Chen, Guantao, Effect of nitrogen additions on root morphology and chemistry in a subtropical bamboo forest, Plant and Soil, 412, 1-2, pp. 441-451, (2017); Chen, Jing, Nitrogen Fertilization Increases Root Growth and Coordinates the Root–Shoot Relationship in Cotton, Frontiers in Plant Science, 11, (2020); Cheng, Yaoyao, The modulation of light quality on carotenoid and tocochromanol biosynthesis in mung bean (Vigna radiata) sprouts, Food Chemistry: Molecular Sciences, 6, (2023)",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,,,,,15735044; 01676857,,PTCED,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003206491

Despite the usage of chemical fungicides to combat the pathogen, their effectiveness remains limited in controlling blast disease. Consequently, there exists a pressing need to discover a novel natural biofungicide for efficient blast disease management. To address this challenge, we combined machine learning-based bioactivity prediction with virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the molecular interactions between forty-eight plant-derived natural compounds and the effector protein, Avr-PikE, an avirulence protein from Magnaporthe oryzae. Among the evaluated phytochemicals, Calotropin, Lupeol, and Azadirachtin emerged as the top-ranking molecules based on their favourable affinity through molecular docking with the effector. MD simulations for 100 ns were conducted to ascertain the stability and reliability of these compounds. Through classical and steered MD simulations and free energy calculations, it was revealed that these selected compounds exhibit stable and favourable energies, thereby establishing strong binding interactions with Avr-PikE. These screened natural metabolites were also found to meet crucial criteria for fungicide-likeness. To support accessibility and broader applications, we also developed a bioactivity prediction app (http://login1.cabgrid.res.in:5260/), allowing users to predict bioactivity against fungi based on our model. The efficacy of one potent compound, Lupeol, was validated through in vitro experiments, confirming its significant antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae. Such biofungicides hold promise for enhancing disease management strategies and mitigating the impact of blast disease on cereal crops. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Azadirachta Indica; Calotrophis Procera; Machine Learning; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Phytochemicals; Virtual Screening; Azadirachtin; Kaempferol; Limonene; Linalool; Lupeol; Nimbin; Nimbolide; Prochloraz; Protein; Quercetin; Fungal Proteins; Phytochemicals; Fungi; Fungicides; Metabolites; Azadirachta Indica; Biofungicides; Blast Disease; Calotrophi Procera; Dynamics Simulation; Machine-learning; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Molecular Dynamic Simulation; Phytochemical; Virtual Screening; Molecular Docking; Avr Pike Protein; Azadirachtin; Calactin; Calotropin; Catalase Peroxidases 2; Flavylium; Fungal Protein; Fungicide; Gigantol; Herbicide; Kaempferol; Limonene; Linalool; Lupeol; Manganese Lipoxygenase; Margolonone; Natural Product; Nimbin; Nimbionol; Nimbionone; Nimbolide; Nimbosone; Nimbosterin; Phytochemical; Prochloraz; Protein; Quercetin; Scytalone Dehydratase; Sterol; Tricyclazole; Unclassified Drug; Antifungal Activity; Article; Binding Affinity; Biological Activity; Calculation; Cereal; Chemical Analysis; Clinical Evaluation; Conformational Transition; Controlled Study; Crop; Immune System; In Vitro Study; K Nearest Neighbor; Machine Learning; Molecular Docking; Molecular Dynamics; Molecular Interaction; Nonhuman; Protein Structure; Random Forest; Reliability; Support Vector Machine; Virtual Screening; Ascomycetes; Chemistry; Drug Effect; Magnaporthe; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant Disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Machine Learning; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Phytochemicals; Plant Diseases; Pyricularia Oryzae,Fungi; Fungicides; Metabolites; Azadirachta indica; Biofungicides; Blast disease; Calotrophi procera; Dynamics simulation; Machine-learning; Magnaporthe oryzae; Molecular dynamic simulation; Phytochemical; Virtual Screening; Molecular docking; avr pike protein; azadirachtin; calactin; calotropin; catalase peroxidases 2; flavylium; fungal protein; fungicide; gigantol; herbicide; kaempferol; limonene; linalool; lupeol; manganese lipoxygenase; margolonone; natural product; nimbin; nimbionol; nimbionone; nimbolide; nimbosone; nimbosterin; phytochemical; prochloraz; protein; quercetin; scytalone dehydratase; sterol; tricyclazole; unclassified drug; antifungal activity; Article; binding affinity; biological activity; calculation; cereal; chemical analysis; clinical evaluation; conformational transition; controlled study; crop; immune system; in vitro study; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; nonhuman; protein structure; random forest; reliability; support vector machine; virtual screening; Ascomycetes; chemistry; drug effect; Magnaporthe; metabolism; microbiology; plant disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Machine Learning; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Phytochemicals; Plant Diseases; Pyricularia oryzae,,"azadirachtin, 11141-17-6; kaempferol, 520-18-3; limonene, 138-86-3, 5989-27-5; linalool, 78-70-6; lupeol, 545-47-1; nimbin, 5945-86-8; nimbolide, 25990-37-8; prochloraz, 67747-09-5; protein, 67254-75-5; quercetin, 117-39-5; Fungal Proteins; Phytochemicals","Computational facilities provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute are gratefully acknowledged.

Globally, zinc deficiency affects approximately 2 billion people, leading to serious issues such as immune problems and growth delays, particularly in developing countries. In the U.S., around 10% of adolescents experienced zinc deficiency in 2021, with a higher prevalence among teenage girls. In Europe, deficiency rates are generally low but can be significant in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In Asia, particularly in rural and low-income areas, deficiency rates range from 20-30%. In Turkey, the prevalence is high due to poor nutrition. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based decision support system to determine zinc deficiency in children and adolescents aged 10-18 years. Methods: This machine learning-based study was conducted with 370 adolescents aged 10-18 years to assess their zinc deficiency. The dataset consists of 8 feature vectors and an output vector. The machine learning methods used in the analysis include logistic regression, naive bayes, decision tree (CART), K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting classifier, AdaBoost classifier, bagging classifier, random forest classifier, multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier, and XGBoost (XGB) classifier. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to assess the performance of these methods. Including specific values for these metrics, such as ""SVM achieved 94.6% accuracy,"" would allow readers to quickly compare the effectiveness of the models. Different metrics serve various purposes: Accuracy provides an overall view of performance, precision and recall highlight specific aspects, and the F1 score balances precision and recall. Results: The mean age of the patients in the dataset was 13.79 ± 1.18 years. Of the children, 64.32% (n = 238) were female and 35.68% (n = 132) were male. It was found that 62.7% (n = 232) of the children had low zinc levels, while 37.3% (n = 138) did not require zinc supplementation. Thirteen different machine learning methods were applied to a 70% training and 30% testing set. As a result, the SVM method provided the most successful outcome with 94.6% accuracy. Implementing the SVM-based system in pediatric clinics could improve efficiency and patient care by automatically detecting high-risk zinc deficiency patients based on lab results, providing early intervention alerts for faster treatment, and improving health outcomes. Highlighting these practical applications could increase the study’s appeal to healthcare professionals by demonstrating its real-world benefits. Providing detailed information on these applications would enhance the study’s clarity and practical value, making it more valuable for researchers and healthcare providers interested in AI tools for adolescent health. Conclusions: This study concluded that machine learning methods can effectively determine zinc deficiency in children. The SVM method demonstrated superior classification performance compared to the other methods. An SVM-based decision support system could be integrated into pediatric outpatient clinics to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adolescents; Decision Support System; Machine Learning; Zinc Deficiency; C Reactive Protein; Calcium; Ferritin; Iron; Phosphorus; Sodium; Zinc; C Reactive Protein; Calcium; Ferritin; Iron; Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; Phosphorus; Sodium; Vitamin D; Zinc; Adaboost Classifier; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Bagging Classifier; Bayesian Learning; Child; Classifier; Clinical Outcome; Comparative Effectiveness; Controlled Study; Cross-sectional Study; Decision Support System; Decision Tree; Descriptive Research; F1 Score; Female; Gradient Boosting Classifier; Health Status; High Risk Population; Human; Intermethod Comparison; K Nearest Neighbor; Logistic Regression Analysis; Machine Learning; Major Clinical Study; Male; Measurement; Measurement Accuracy; Measurement Precision; Measurement Recall; Mineral Supplementation; Multilayer Perceptron; Nutritional Status; Patient Care; Pediatric Hospital; Prediction; Random Forest; Retrospective Study; Support Vector Machine; Xgboost Classifier; Zinc Deficiency; Zinc Metabolism,C reactive protein; calcium; ferritin; iron; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; phosphorus; sodium; vitamin D; zinc; AdaBoost classifier; adolescent; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; bagging classifier; Bayesian learning; child; classifier; clinical outcome; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; cross-sectional study; decision support system; decision tree; descriptive research; F1 score; female; gradient boosting classifier; health status; high risk population; human; intermethod comparison; k nearest neighbor; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; measurement; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; measurement recall; mineral supplementation; multilayer perceptron; nutritional status; patient care; pediatric hospital; prediction; random forest; retrospective study; support vector machine; XGBoost classifier; zinc deficiency; zinc metabolism,,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; ferritin, 9007-73-2; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; sodium, 7440-23-5; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6","We would like to thank Izmir Bak\u0131r\u00E7ay University Health Artificial Intelligence Studies Application and Research Centre and S.B.U.

Genome sequencing advancements have led to the identification of a myriad of NLRs in numerous agriculturally important plant species. However, deciphering which NLRs recognize specific pathogen effectors remains challenging. Predicting NLR–effector interactions in silico will provide a more targeted approach for experimental validation, critical for elucidating function, and advancing our understanding of NLR-triggered immunity. In this study, NLR–effector protein complex structures were predicted using AlphaFold2-Multimer for all experimentally validated NLR–effector interactions reported in literature. Binding affinities- and energies were predicted using 97 machine learning models from Area-Affinity. We show that AlphaFold2-Multimer predicted structures have acceptable accuracy and can be used to investigate NLR–effector interactions in silico. Binding affinities for 58 NLR–effector complexes ranged between −8.5 and −10.6 log(K), and binding energies between −11.8 and −14.4 kcal/mol−1, depending on the Area-Affinity model used. For 2427 “forced” NLR–effector complexes, these estimates showed larger variability, enabling identification of novel NLR–effector interactions with 99% accuracy using an Ensemble machine learning model. The narrow range of binding energies- and affinities for “true” interactions suggest a specific change in Gibbs free energy, and thus conformational change, is required for NLR activation. This is the first study to provide a method for predicting NLR–effector interactions, applicable to all pathosystems. Finally, the NLR–Effector Interaction Classification (NEIC) resource can streamline research efforts by identifying NLRs important for plant–pathogen resistance, advancing our understanding of plant immunity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Effector; Effector Triggered Immunity; Nlr–effector Interactions; Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat; Plant–pathogen Interactions; Technical Advance; Leucine-rich Repeat Proteins; Nlr Proteins; Plant Proteins; Plant Diseases; Vegetation; Effector; Effector Triggered Immunity; Leucine-rich Repeats; Nucleotide Binding; Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat; Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat–effector Interaction; Plant/pathogen Interaction; Technical Advances; Binding Energy; Accuracy; Activation; Affinity; Binding; Leucine; Machinery; Plants; Structures; Leucine Rich Repeat Protein; Nucleotide Binding Oligomerization Domain Like Receptor; Plant Protein; Protein Binding; Chemistry; Computer Simulation; Genetics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Immunology; Machine Learning; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant; Plant Disease; Plant Immunity; Computer Simulation; Host-pathogen Interactions; Leucine-rich Repeat Proteins; Machine Learning; Nlr Proteins; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Protein Binding,Plant diseases; Vegetation; Effector; Effector triggered immunity; Leucine-rich repeats; Nucleotide binding; Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat; Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat–effector interaction; Plant/pathogen interaction; Technical advances; Binding energy; Accuracy; Activation; Affinity; Binding; Leucine; Machinery; Plants; Structures; leucine rich repeat protein; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; plant protein; protein binding; chemistry; computer simulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunology; machine learning; metabolism; microbiology; plant; plant disease; plant immunity; Computer Simulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Leucine-Rich Repeat Proteins; Machine Learning; NLR Proteins; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Protein Binding,,Leucine-Rich Repeat Proteins; NLR Proteins; Plant Proteins,,"Adachi, Hiroaki, NLR receptor networks in plants, Essays in Biochemistry, 66, 5, pp. 541-549, (2022); Ammari, Mais G., HPIDB 2.0: a curated database for host-pathogen interactions, Database : the journal of biological databases and curation, 2016, (2016); Barragán, Ana Cristina, Plant NLR diversity: The known unknowns of pan-NLRomes, Plant Cell, 33, 4, pp. 814-831, (2021); Basu, Sankar, DockQ: A quality measure for protein-protein docking models, PLOS ONE, 11, 8, (2016); Bernoux, Maud, Comparative analysis of the flax immune receptors L6 and L7 suggests an equilibrium-based switch activation model, Plant Cell, 28, 1, pp. 146-159, (2016); Brabham, Helen J., Barley MLA3 recognizes the host-specificity effector Pwl2 from Magnaporthe oryzae, Plant Cell, 36, 2, pp. 447-470, (2024); Bret, Hélène, From interaction networks to interfaces, scanning intrinsically disordered regions using AlphaFold2, Nature Communications, 15, 1, (2024); Champouret, Nicolas, Phytophthora infestans isolates lacking class I ipiO variants are virulent on Rpi-blbl potato, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 22, 12, pp. 1535-1545, (2009); Collins, Keeley W., Dockground resource for protein recognition studies, Protein Science, 31, 12, (2022); Contreras, Mauricio P., NLR receptors in plant immunity: making sense of the alphabet soup, EMBO Reports, 24, 10, (2023)",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,,,,,09607412; 1365313X,,PLJUE,40304719,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004204267

Therefore, we investigated how long-term continuous cropping would impact the composition of microbial communities and their feedback to flue-cured tobacco. We selected flue-cured tobacco with contrasting agronomic traits from three fields under continuous cultivation for over a decade, where well-grown plants had 1.45, 1.28, 1.17 and 1.25 times greater height, leaf number, length and width than poorly grown tobacco, respectively. The root zone soils of flue-cured tobacco with contrasting agronomic traits were collected to analyse the community structure and network characteristics of soil bacteria and fungi. Although bacterial and fungal diversity, dominated by stochastic processes, remained invariant between contrasting agronomic traits, community composition differed significantly at the order level. Specifically, the well-grown tobacco was enriched with Micrococcales, Xanthomonadales and Eurotiales groups known for their role in organic matter degradation. In contrast, poorly grown tobacco was uniquely enriched with bacteria typically involved in nitrate cycling, such as Nitrospira, Nocardioides and Betaproteobacteria. Bacterial function prediction based on Tax4Fun2 showed that functions related to amino acid cycling were enriched in the root zone of well-grown tobacco. Additionally, the rhizosphere of well-grown tobacco exhibited a more complex bacterial network with larger network hubs than that of poorly grown tobacco. In conclusion, the enrichment of organic matter decomposers and nitrate transformers in the root zones of continuously cropped flue-cured tobacco significantly impacts agronomic traits, with a complex soil bacterial network and key network hubs playing a crucial role in maintaining tobacco growth. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ecological Networks; Flue-cured Tobacco; Microbial Community; Plant-microbes Interaction; Agronomic Traits; Community Is; Ecological Networks; Flue-cured Tobacco; Microbial Communities; Network Hubs; Plant-microbe Interactions; Root Zone; Soil Microbial; Soil Microbial Community; Plant Diseases; Community Structure; Continuous Cropping; Cultivation; Ecological Impact; Microbial Community; Organic Matter; Rhizosphere; Tobacco,Agronomic traits; Community IS; Ecological networks; Flue-cured tobacco; Microbial communities; Network hubs; Plant-microbe interactions; Root zone; Soil microbial; Soil microbial community; Plant diseases; community structure; continuous cropping; cultivation; ecological impact; microbial community; organic matter; rhizosphere; tobacco,,,"Funding text 1: This study was financially supported by the Science and Technology Project of Qianxinan Branch, Guizhou Tobacco Company (2022-03).

Predicting PDR protein is essential for understanding plant–pathogen interactions and developing strategies for crop protection. This study proposes a hybrid model for predicting and designing PDR proteins against plant-invading pathogens. Initially, we tried alignment-based approaches, such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) for similarity search and MERCI for motif search. These alignment-based approaches exhibit very poor coverage or sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, we developed alignment-free or machine learning (ML)-based methods using compositional features of proteins. Our ML-based model, developed using compositional features of proteins, achieved a maximum performance area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.91. The performance of our model improved significantly from AUROC of 0.91–0.95 when we used evolutionary information instead of protein sequence. Finally, we developed a hybrid or ensemble model that combined our best ML model with BLAST and obtained the highest AUROC of 0.98 on the validation dataset. We trained and tested our models on a training dataset and evaluated them on a validation dataset. None of the proteins in our validation dataset are more than 40% similar to proteins in the training dataset. One of the objectives of this study is to facilitate the scientific community working in plant biology.

However, due to the lack of an efficient genetic transformation system in Pst, progress in effector function studies has been slow. Here, we modeled the structures of 15,201 effectors from twelve Pst races or isolates, a Puccinia striiformis isolate, and one Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei isolate using AlphaFold2. Of these, 8,102 folds were successfully predicted, and we performed sequence- and structure-based annotations of these effectors. These effectors were classified into 410 structure clusters and 1,005 sequence clusters. Sequence lengths varied widely, with a concentration between 101-250 amino acids, and motif analysis revealed that 47% and 5.81% of the predicted effectors contain known effector motifs [Y/F/W]xC and RxLR, respectively highlighting the structural conservation across a substantial portion of the effectors. Subcellular localization predictions indicated a predominant cytoplasmic localization, with notable chloroplast and nuclear presence. Structure-guided analysis significantly enhances effector prediction efficiency as demonstrated by the 75% among 8,102 have structural annotation. The clustering and annotation prediction both based on the sequence and structure homologies allowed us to determine the adopted folding or fold families of the effectors. A common feature observed was the formation of structural homologies from different sequences. In our study, one of the comparative structural analyses revealed a new structure family with a core structure of four helices, including Pst27791, PstGSRE4, and PstSIE1, which target key wheat immune pathway proteins, impacting the host immune functions. Further comparative structural analysis showed similarities between Pst effectors and effectors from other pathogens, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50, Zt-KP4-1, and MoHrip2, highlighting a possibility of convergent evolutionary strategies, yet to be supported by further data encompassing on some evolutionarily distant species. Currently, our initial analysis is the most one on Pst effectors’ sequence, structural and annotation relationships providing a novel foundation to advance our future understanding of Pst pathogenicity and evolution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase; Glycosidase; Fungal Proteins; Origin 2022; Dynamic Response; Biological Functions; Classifieds; Computational Studies; Control Strategies; Genetic Transformation Systems; Puccinia Striiformis; Sequence Lengths; Stripe Rust; Structural Characterization; Structure-based; Immune System; Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase; Glycosidase; Proteome; Signal Peptide; Virulence Factor; Fungal Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Blumeria Graminis; Chloroplast; Effector Cell; Genetic Transformation; Machine Learning; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Melampsora Lini; Nonhuman; Pathogenicity; Phylogenetic Tree; Principal Component Analysis; Protein Database; Protein Motif; Protein Structure; Puccinia Striiformis F.

The production rate and quality of cassava crops are affected by several diseases. However, the manual identification of diseases is challenging and requires considerable time because of the lack of field professionals and the limited availability of clear and distinct information. Consequently, the agricultural management system is seeking an efficient and lightweight method that can be deployable to edged devices for detecting diseases at an early stage. To address these issues and accurately categorize different diseases, a very effective and lightweight framework called CDDNet has been introduced. We used MobileNetV3Small framework as a backbone feature for extracting optimized, discriminating, and distinct features. These features are empirically validated at the early intermediate stage. Additionally, we modified the soft attention module to effectively prioritize the diseased regions and enhance significant cassava plant disease-related features for efficient cassava disease detection. RESULTS: Our proposed method achieved accuracies of 98.95%, 97.03%, and 98.25% on Cassava Image Dataset, Cassava Plant Disease Merged (2019–2020) Dataset, and the newly created Cassava Plant Composite Dataset, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed technique outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, parameter count, and frames per second values, ultimately making the proposed CDDNet the best one for real-time processing. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the importance of a lightweight and efficient technique for cassava disease detection and classification in a real-time environment. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of modified soft attention on model performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

They show significant promise in agriculture and medicine. However, current AMP prediction methods often face shortcomings such as low efficiency, strong data dependence, and high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose PCLPAMP, a model incorporating prompt tuning and contrastive learning for plant AMP prediction. Continuous prompts guide the protein language model (LM) ProtT5 in extracting task-specific feature embeddings, while contrastive learning optimizes feature distribution to improve discrimination. PCLPAMP achieves an accuracy of 94.15%, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model LMPred-T5XL UNI by 2.63%. Additionally, it outperforms the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning approach in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

However, plant infectious diseases pay significant challenges in declining both the quality and yield. Another key factor limiting crop growth worldwide is a lack of essential nutrients. Deficiencies in macronutrients (P, N, Ca, Mg and K) and micronutrients (Cu, Zn, and Mo) have a major impact on plant growth and development, ultimately leading to plant death. However, with artificial intelligence (AI), it is now possible to detect not only symptoms, but also identify the specific pathogens, understand plant–pathogen interactions, and even analyse nutrient deficiencies in both soil and plants. Thus, AI is necessitated to address these issues, which allows for real-time, accurate analysis of plant health using robots and probes, making it faster and more precise than traditional methods of plant tissue and soil testing. Advanced AI techniques—such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—are now being applied to detect infectious diseases and nutrient levels. This chapter explores the current role of AI in diagnosing plant infectious diseases and identifying nutrient needs that offering guidance for effective management practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Diseases; Nutrients; Plants; Sustainable Agriculture; Fertilizer; Algorithm; Artificial Intelligence; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop; Deep Learning; Image Analysis; K Nearest Neighbor; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Nutrient Management; Phytopathogen; Plant Disease; Plant Growth; Plant Microorganism Interaction; Plant Nutrient; Plant Nutrition; Plant Pathogen Interaction; Plant Pest; Prediction; Random Forest; Soil Health; Support Vector Machine; Sustainable Agriculture,fertilizer; algorithm; artificial intelligence; convolutional neural network; crop; deep learning; image analysis; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; nonhuman; nutrient management; phytopathogen; plant disease; plant growth; plant microorganism interaction; plant nutrient; plant nutrition; plant pathogen interaction; plant pest; prediction; random forest; soil health; support vector machine; sustainable agriculture,,,,"Abdullah, Araz Sedqi, Host–multi-pathogen warfare: Pathogen interactions in co-infected plants, Frontiers in Plant Science, 8, (2017); Emmanuel, Abioye Abiodun, Precision Irrigation Management Using Machine Learning and Digital Farming Solutions, AgriEngineering, 4, 1, pp. 70-103, (2022); Abuhayi, Biniyam Mulugeta, Coffee disease classification using Convolutional Neural Network based on feature concatenation, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 39, (2023); Agarwal, Mohit, ToLeD: Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using Convolution Neural Network, Procedia Computer Science, 167, pp. 293-301, (2020); Plant Pathology, (1997); Ahmad Loti, Nurul Nabilah, Integrated analysis of machine learning and deep learning in chili pest and disease identification, Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 101, 9, pp. 3582-3594, (2021); Aitkenhead, Matthew J., Predicting soil chemical composition and other soil parameters from field observations using a neural network, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 82, pp. 108-116, (2012); Akın, Melekşen A., Analysis of macro nutrient related growth responses using multivariate adaptive regression splines, Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture, 140, 3, pp. 661-670, (2020); Al-Amin, Md A., Prediction of rice disease from leaves using deep convolution neural network towards a digital agricultural system, (2019); Alzubaidi, Laith, Review of deep learning: concepts, CNN architectures, challenges, applications, future directions, Journal of Big Data, 8, 1, (2021)","Srivastava, A.; Mishra, V.",Academic Press Inc.,,,,,,5809517,9780128235409; 9780123694782; 0125215339; 0125215304; 0123694787; 9780128208113; 9780125215312; 9780128211458; 9780443136894; 9780125215305,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214655039

Deficiency of one of these vitamins causes growth retardation in plants. Vitamin deficiencies in lettuce grown in hydroponic systems can negatively affect plant development and create various problems. Therefore, it is critical to provide all the vitamin and mineral balances that plants need in hydroponic systems. In this study, the development of lettuce, which has an important place in daily life, was examined in detail. Deep learning techniques were applied to images of lettuce plants using various You Only Look Once (YOLO) models (YOLOV12 and YOLOV11). Various metrics were calculated for each YOLO version to evaluate performance. These metrics include precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP)50 (average accuracy), and mAP50–95 (average accuracy at different intersection over union [IoU]), thresholds). A balance was created between the classes on the lettuce images obtained using data augmentation techniques, which allowed the model to be trained more robustly. In the tests conducted with the augmented dataset, the mAP50 value of the YOLOV12 model was calculated as 0.984 and the mAP50–95 value as 0.957. This reveals the high performance of the model in correctly recognizing nutritional deficiencies. On the other hand, the YOLOV11 model achieved lower results, such as 0.975 mAP50 and 0.944 mAP50–95 in all classes. This study significantly improved the object detection performance by integrating novel attention modules into YOLOV11 and YOLOV12 models to detect nutrient deficiencies of lettuce plants early and accurately in soilless agriculture. Not only the comparison of models, but also the generalization and robustness of the model were strengthened with innovative modules that provide dynamic adaptation to environmental variables. This novel approach provides tangible contributions to both academic literature and practical applications in AI-supported early detection and yield optimization in sustainable hydroponic agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computer Vision; Map50; Map50–95; Nutrient Deficiency; Yolo; Deep Learning; Hydroponics; Learning Systems; Lettuce; Nutrients; Object Detection; Object Recognition; Statistical Tests; Sustainable Development; Vitamins; Automatic Detection; Growth-retardation; Hydroponic Systems; Map50; Map50–95; Nitrogen Phosphorus; Nutrient Deficiency; Performance; Real- Time; You Only Look Once; Computer Vision; Copyrights,Deep learning; Hydroponics; Learning systems; Lettuce; Nutrients; Object detection; Object recognition; Statistical tests; Sustainable development; Vitamins; Automatic Detection; Growth-retardation; Hydroponic systems; Map50; Map50–95; Nitrogen phosphorus; Nutrient deficiency; Performance; Real- time; You only look once; Computer vision; Copyrights,,,,"World Population Prospects 2019, (2019); Future of Food and Agriculture Alternative Pathways to 2050, (2018); Godfray, Charles H., Food security: The challenge of feeding 9 billion people, Science, 327, 5967, pp. 812-818, (2010); Ahmed, Nazir, Advancing horizons in vegetable cultivation: a journey from ageold practices to high-tech greenhouse cultivation—a review, Frontiers in Plant Science, 15, (2024); Hydroponics A Practical Guide for the Soilless Grower, (2025); Agricultura Urban Agriculture and the Heritage Potential of Agrarian Landscape, (2020); Hydroponic Food Production A Definitive Guidebook for the Advanced Home Gardener and the Commercial Hydroponic Grower, (2012); Badgujar, Chetan M., Agricultural object detection with You Only Look Once (YOLO) Algorithm: A bibliometric and systematic literature review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 223, (2024); International Journal of Scientific Research and Management, (2024); Sudhakar, M., Computer Vision Based Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Identification of Nutrient Deficiency in Crops: A Survey, Nature Environment and Pollution Technology, 22, 3, pp. 1387-1399, (2023)",,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,,,,16877268; 1687725X,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014499066

It is rich in vitamin B12, considered to be the best ever compensation of vitamin B12 for vegetarians as it is abundantly present in non-veg foods. Potato is the most preferred vegetable to consume from kids to adults. The potato crop is prone to numerous infections like bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in its growing stages. The production is immensely affected by the diseases that occur in its sprout development stage. Diseases that occur in crops hinder the economy of agriculture as they lead to huge demands. The predominant devastating diseases influencing the growth and production of potatoes are late and early blight diseases. Detecting the diseases, especially the diseases that occurred in its initial stages, assists in preventing the loss in production and to improve the yield. A decrease in production results in increasing cost and demand.

Farmers and agronomists often mistake nutrient deficiencies for diseases, leading to incorrect crop treatments. This study proposes a deep learning model for classifying micronutrient deficiencies (m-ND), evaluating their severity, and distinguishing them from diseases in banana and coffee crops. To address common classification challenges, the model is initially trained and validated on images of both nutritional deficiencies and visually similar disease symptoms. To assess its robustness, we also evaluated it on a coffee crop dataset from Mendeley. The proposed method, D-PAN - a modified Pyramid Attention Network (PAN) uses a dynamic attention mechanism to process multi-scale input images. Model performance was compared with various vision transformer (ViT) based channel attention methods and a weighted ensemble of Transformer models combined with a modified convolution neural network (CNN). The model achieved top accuracies of 98.80% for banana and 94.60% for coffee, with reduced misclassification errors. Experimental results show that the framework maintains low complexity, improves accuracy by an average of 2.9%, and reduces parameters by 1.64 to 3.83 times compared to other attention methods. Overall, the proposed model surpasses all evaluated state-of-the-art attention mechanisms, achieving strong performance across recall, accuracy, precision, and F1-score. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Channel Attention; Deep Learning; Micro-nutrient Deficiency; Pyramid Attention Network; Weighted Ensemble Transformer; Classification (of Information); Coffee; Crops; Fruits; Learning Systems; Nutrients; Nutrition; Attention Mechanisms; Channel Attention; Deep Learning; Fine Grained; Learning Frameworks; Micro-nutrient Deficiency; Nutrient Deficiency; Pyramid Attention Network; Reduced-complexity; Weighted Ensemble Transformer,Classification (of information); Coffee; Crops; Fruits; Learning systems; Nutrients; Nutrition; Attention mechanisms; Channel attention; Deep learning; Fine grained; Learning frameworks; Micro-nutrient deficiency; Nutrient deficiency; Pyramid attention network; Reduced-complexity; Weighted ensemble transformer,,,,"Anitha, K., Feature Extraction and Classification of Plant Leaf Diseases Using Deep Learning Techniques, Computers, Materials and Continua, 73, 1, pp. 233-247, (2022); Huang, Qianding, Knowledge Distillation Facilitates the Lightweight and Efficient Plant Diseases Detection Model, Plant Phenomics, 5, (2023); Radhamani, R., A Technique for Identifying Micronutrient Deficiency of Sugarcane Plant by Root Feeding Method, Sugar Tech, 15, 4, pp. 420-423, (2013); Precision Agriculture, (2023); Rahadiyan, Deffa, Feature aggregation for nutrient deficiency identification in chili based on machine learning, Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture, 8, pp. 77-90, (2023); Multimedia Tools and Applications, (2023); Haris, Sona, Nutrient Deficiency Detection in Mobile Captured Guava Plants using Light Weight Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, pp. 1190-1193, (2023); Journal of Pharmaceutical Negative Results, (2023); Sharma, Mayuri, Identification of rice leaf diseases and deficiency disorders using a novel DeepBatch technique, Open Life Sciences, 18, 1, (2023); Selvaraj, Michael Gomez, AI-powered banana diseases and pest detection, Plant Methods, 15, 1, (2019)",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,,21693536,,,,English,Article,aip,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013369755

The cultivation of cassava faces severe risks because bacterial and viral infections cause yield decreases of as much as 70% within one season, which threatens the food security of smallholder farmers extensively. The research develops a modern deep learning-based diagnostic platform to demonstrate accurate disease classification of cassava leaf samples. ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 networks backed by boosting methods, including AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting, serve to improve classification outcomes from the proposed approach. A transfer learning approach and attention mechanisms enhance feature extraction within the system, which processes the 21,367 labeled images containing cassava leaf samples both in their healthy and diseased states using real-world image noise reduction methods. The proposed model produces classification outcomes with more than 99% precision for various disease categories, which surpasses conventional manual inspections and spreadsheet-based approaches. The conducted research established a mobile diagnosis tool that enables quick disease detection for cassava, thus empowering farmers to apply timely actions to promote sustainable agricultural growth and increase food security. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cassava Disease Detection; Cnn-based Classification; Hybrid Deep Learning Approach; Image-based Crop Health Assessment; Plant Disease Identification; Sustainable Agriculture; Adaptive Boosting; Classification (of Information); Computer Aided Diagnosis; Crops; Cultivation; Deep Learning; Food Supply; Noise Abatement; Plant Diseases; Plants (botany); Smart Agriculture; Cassavum Disease Detection; Cnn-based Classification; Disease Detection; Health Assessments; Hybrid Deep Learning Approach; Image-based; Image-based Crop Health Assessment; Learning Approach; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Identification; Sustainable Agriculture; Image Enhancement,Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Crops; Cultivation; Deep learning; Food supply; Noise abatement; Plant diseases; Plants (botany); Smart agriculture; Cassavum disease detection; CNN-based classification; Disease detection; Health assessments; Hybrid deep learning approach; Image-based; Image-based crop health assessment; Learning approach; Plant disease; Plant disease identification; Sustainable agriculture; Image enhancement,,,,"Manthey, Frank A., Starch: Sources and Processing, pp. 160-164, (2015); Mkamilo, Geoffrey S., Impact of viral diseases and whiteflies on the yield and quality of cassava, Journal of Plant Diseases and Protection, 131, 3, pp. 959-970, (2024); Legg, James P., Cassava virus diseases: Biology, epidemiology, and management, Advances in Virus Research, 91, 1, pp. 85-142, (2015); Parmar, Aditya, Crops that feed the world: Production and improvement of cassava for food, feed, and industrial uses, Food Security, 9, 5, pp. 907-927, (2017); Yao, Jianping, Machine learning for leaf disease classification: data, techniques and applications, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, pp. 3571-3616, (2023); Ayu, H.

They secrete proteins called effectors, which enable infection through interactions with diverse host proteins. These interactions are fundamentally important to plant disease and its practical control. New artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can predict many individual protein structures to near experimental accuracy. Although these techniques also predict protein complexes, they are not as accurate as single-protein models. Use of AI to study interactions between fungal pathogen effectors and plant proteins is currently limited. However, despite some challenges, early adoption of AI has highlighted its potential. General improvements in AI-assisted protein complex modelling may create more opportunities in future.

Secreted microbial signaling molecules initiate and mediate symbiosis by binding to structurally compatible plant receptors. For example, lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), produced by nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria and various fungi, are recognized by plant lysin motif receptor-like kinases (LysM-RLKs), which activate the common symbiotic pathway. Accurately predicting these molecular interactions could reveal complementary signatures underlying the initial stages of endosymbiosis. Despite the breakthrough in protein-ligand structure prediction with deep learning-based tools, such as AlphaFold3, the large size and highly flexible nature of signaling compounds like LCOs present major challenges for detailed structural characterization and binding-affinity prediction. Typical structure-/physics-based methods of ligand virtual screening are designed for small, drug-like molecules, often rely on high-resolution, experimentally determined structures of the protein receptors, and rarely achieve sufficient sampling to obtain converged thermodynamic quantities with large ligands. In this study, we developed a hybrid molecular dynamics/machine learning (MD/ML) approach capable of predicting binding affinity rankings with high accuracy in systems involving large, flexible ligands, despite limited experimental structural information. Using coarse initial structural models, the predictions using the MD/ML workflow achieved strong alignment with experimental trends, particularly in the top-affinity tier for four legume LysM-RLKs (LYR3) binding to LCOs and a chitooligosaccharide. Furthermore, the MD-based conformation selection protocol provided critical structural insights into substrate specificity and binding mechanisms. This study demonstrates a powerful method to screen for challenging cognate ligand-receptors and advance our understanding of the molecular basis of microbial colonization in plants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Lipo-chitooligosaccharides; Lysm; Machine Learning; Plant-microbe Interactions; Protein-ligand Binding Affinity Prediction; Signaling Molecules; Nitrogen; Phosphotransferase; Bacteria; Binding Energy; Biochemistry; Biological Membranes; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Molecular Dynamics; Plant Diseases; Plants (botany); Binding Affinities; Chitooligosaccharides; Lipo-chitooligosaccharide; Lysm; Machine-learning; Plant-microbe Interactions; Protein-ligand Binding Affinities; Protein-ligand Binding Affinity Prediction; Receptor-like Kinase; Signaling Molecules; Learning Systems; Ligands; Ligand; Nitrogen; Oligosaccharide; Phosphotransferase; Receptor; Article; Binding Affinity; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Endosymbiosis; Enzyme Specificity; Ligand Binding; Machine Learning; Microbial Colonization; Molecular Dynamics; Molecular Interaction; Nonhuman; Plant Microorganism Interaction; Rhizobiales; Signal Transduction; Structural Model; Structure Analysis; Symbiosis; Thermodynamics,Bacteria; Binding energy; Biochemistry; Biological membranes; Deep learning; Forecasting; Molecular dynamics; Plant diseases; Plants (botany); Binding affinities; Chitooligosaccharides; Lipo-chitooligosaccharide; Lysm; Machine-learning; Plant-microbe interactions; Protein-ligand binding affinities; Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction; Receptor-like kinase; Signaling molecules; Learning systems; Ligands; ligand; nitrogen; oligosaccharide; phosphotransferase; receptor; Article; binding affinity; controlled study; deep learning; endosymbiosis; enzyme specificity; ligand binding; machine learning; microbial colonization; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; nonhuman; plant microorganism interaction; Rhizobiales; signal transduction; structural model; structure analysis; symbiosis; thermodynamics,,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphotransferase, 9031-09-8, 9031-44-1","This research was sponsored by the Genomic Science Program , U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research, as part of the Plant Microbe Interfaces Scientific Focus Area at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( http://pmi.ornl.gov ).

Treatment usually includes lifestyle changes such as exercise, dietary changes, and vitamin supplementation, which is especially important for overweight people or those with metabolic issues. Natural supplements such as inositol, curcumin, vitamin D, N-acetylcysteine, D-chiro-inositol, omega-3 fatty acids, folate, and tocopherol have emerged as intriguing components in PCOS treatment, with possible therapeutic effects. Despite the success of traditional medications, many PCOS patients prefer alternative therapies owing to their perceived efficacy and fewer side effects. Phytochemicals derived from plants such as aloe vera, chamomile, cinnamon, ginseng, fennel, and licorice have received attention for their involvement in PCOS therapy and are frequently seen as a cost-effective and well-tolerated option. Furthermore, AI and machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated significant potential for improving PCOS diagnosis and classification accuracy. AI/ML models can help with early detection and personalized treatment methods by following standardized diagnostic criteria.

The primary objective revolves around the measurement and continuous monitoring of plant leaf color, a crucial indicator of plant health and nutrient status. To accomplish this, a Python program has been developed to systematically monitor and analyze variations in plant leaf color within the same species, and even within individual plants. Additionally, the study extends its focus to nutrient deficiencies, encompassing essential elements like N, P, K, and 13 micronutrients, shedding light on the critical aspect of plant nutrition in nursery settings. To further enrich our comprehension of forest sapling growth, a growth model incorporating deep learning techniques has been meticulously designed. The development and refinement of this model were greatly facilitated by Google CoLab. The next phase of the research will involve thorough field testing of the developed model at a nursery in Bhubaneswar. This testing will include a variety of plant species. The primary objectives are to evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness in real-world scenarios and to explore its scalability for application in larger fields. This interdisciplinary study seamlessly bridges the realms of technology, biology, and agriculture, culminating in the creation of a robust system for efficient forest nursery management and early detection of plant health issues.

Machine learning technology has the potential to greatly improve agriculture by helping farmers make more educated decisions. However, current systems have considerable limitations. Many fertilizer recommendations only address the key nutrients NPK: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, fail to account for water availability, and rely on out-of-date historical data. This study would close these gaps by producing a machine learning system that can help farmers with crop recommendations, fertiliser guidance, and plant disease detection. The algorithm considers micronutrients and organic matter in addition to NPK when recommending fertiliser. It also incorporates water availability and real-time meteorological data to provide more precise crop suggestions, especially important for drought-prone areas. Deep learning methods analyze plant photos to detect diseases early on. Our findings indicate that by incorporating micro nutrients, water data, and real-time climate updates, the system can deliver more precise crop and fertilizer recommendations. The Random Forest and XGBoost models outperform, and the disease detection component helps to prevent crop losses by intervening early. The key takeaway from this study is that merging machine learning with large amounts of data can significantly improve farming techniques, raise crop yields, and provide farmers with reliable insights, thereby enhancing food security and sustainable agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop And Fertilizer Recommendation; Machine Learning; Plant Disease Detection; Random Forest; Real Time Data; Xgboost Model; Agricultural Robots; Combines; Global Warming; Harvesters; Reforestation; Seed; Crop And Fertilizer Recommendation; Disease Detection; Machine-learning; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Detection; Random Forests; Real- Time; Real-time Data; Water Availability; Xgboost Model; Deep Learning,Agricultural robots; Combines; Global warming; Harvesters; Reforestation; Seed; Crop and fertilizer recommendation; Disease detection; Machine-learning; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Random forests; Real- time; Real-time data; Water availability; Xgboost model; Deep learning,,,,"Agro Tech Crop Fertilizer Recommendation System and Disease Prediction System, (2023); International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology Irjet, (2023); International Research Journal on Advanced Engineering Hub Irjaeh, (2024); International Journal of Scientific Research in Science Engineering and Technology Ijsrset, (2022); Garg, Disha, An effective crop recommendation method using machine learning techniques, International Journal of Advanced Technology and Engineering Exploration, 10, 102, pp. 498-514, (2023); Sagunthala Rd Institute of Science and Technology Chennai, (2023); Scalable Computing Practice and Experience, (2024); School of Computer Engineering Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, (2023); Centre of Research and Technology Hellas Certh, (2018); Indian J Fertil, (2022)",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"3rd International Conference on Disruptive Technologies, ICDT 2025",,Greater Noida,208865,,9798331519582,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006460933

We employed web scraping for data collection from different open source, data augmentation techniques like flip, rotation, zoom to enhance the model's performance and enhance generalization capabilities. This research focuses on developing an effective disease detection system for finger millet using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning methodologies. We analyzed with pretrained CNN architectures, such as DenseNet121, VGG16, and VGG19, using a dataset of more than thousands of labelled images collected from diverse agricultural settings. Fine tuning these models ensures optimising model's performance and achieving better accuracy. Among the tested models, DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 96.88%. Additionally, we developed a user-friendly real-time application to disease detection using Streamlit library helping the farmers to detect the disease in mobile for remote access. This study demonstrates the significant use of deep learning techniques like CNN architectures, particularly transfer learning, for developing better crop disease detection systems. By detecting the disease early and prevention at earlier stage will save tonnes of crops.

Further it provides many medicinal and health benefits to the society to treat various degenerative disease. Especially mango leaves are potential source of minerals like nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium and vitamins. In Particular, these most beneficial plant were exposed to various disease in its growing regions due to several environment changes. Hence it becomes mandatory to protect and prevent the plant against the disease using precautionary measures. Even though there exist large solutions to combat these issues still it requires a strong solutions to examine those disease and categorize it into various forms to establish a effective countermeasures. Many researches has been initiated using machine learning and deep learning to detect the disease and its types but those approaches fails to discriminate diseases effectively in early stages. In this work, a new deep learning model entitled as Multivariate Gated Recurrent Network composed of Input layer, hidden layer, abstract layer and output layer contains various state like hidden state, forgot state, update state and Reset state is employed to analyze the disease region of the image in detail towards effective discrimination in early stages. In particular abstraction layer has been combined with graph cut segmentation algorithm to improves the efficiency of the network by searching and grouping of seed points which represents the infected region of leafs has common attributes. Those common attributes generate the best features for classification. Further optimization of gated recurrent network is carried out using grey wolf optimization to eliminate the network over fitting issues on increasing the speed and accuracy of the network to identify and classify the regions infected of different diseases on the plant leafs on different diseases perspectives. Experimental analysis of proposed architecture on cross fold validation of plant village dataset explains the model accuracy and efficiency with respect to execution performance in terms of training accuracy and validation accuracy respectively for disease identification. GWO and multivariate GRU work together to automate disease diagnosis with low computing overhead, advancing accurate, real-time agricultural disease management. This research advances our understanding of plant disease detection while providing a scalable, reliable, and optimal approach that may be modified for comparable horticultural and agricultural uses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm; Mango Leaf Disease; Multivariate Gated Recurrent Network; Recurrent Neural Network,,,,,"Krizhevsky, Alex, ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Communications of the ACM, 60, 6, pp. 84-90, (2017); International Journal of Application or Innovation in Engineering Management, (2013); International Journal of Innovative and Emerging Research in Engineering, (2015); Militante, Sammy V., Plant Leaf Detection and Disease Recognition using Deep Learning, pp. 579-582, (2019); Arya, Sunayana, A Comparative Study of CNN and AlexNet for Detection of Disease in Potato and Mango leaf, (2019); Comparison of Plant Leaf Classification Using Modified Alexnet and Support Vector Machine; Mia, Md Rasel, Mango leaf disease recognition using neural network and support vector machine, Iran Journal of Computer Science, 3, 3, pp. 185-193, (2020); Using Deep Transfer Learning for Image Based Plant Disease Identification, (2020); Islam, Farabee, Application of Transfer Learning to Detect Potato Disease from Leaf Image, pp. 127-130, (2019); Chouhan, Siddharth Singh, Bacterial foraging optimization based radial basis function neural network (BRBFNN) for identification and classification of plant leaf diseases: An automatic approach towards plant pathology, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 8852-8863, (2018)",,Little Lion Scientific,,,,,,19928645; 18173195,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212871338

In this study, a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) is proposed to expand the data scale and combines laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) with three machine learning methods for mineral elements analysis in Cr-stressed rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves. In the quantitative analysis of mineral elements, the proposed method improved the prediction performance for Cu, K, Mg, Mn, and Na, except for Ca and Fe, demonstrating the effectiveness of data augmentation in enhancing the quantitative models. Mapping the distribution of Ca, Fe, Mg, K, Mn, and Na in rice leaves shows higher concentrations towards the apical regions and approximately symmetrical distribution along the leaf vein. Additionally, Fe, K, and Mn concentrations are significantly lower in Cr-polluted leaves compared to uncontaminated leaves.

This study employed eight advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the status of micronutrient supplementation among pregnant women in 12 East African countries, using recent demographic health survey (DHS) data. The analysis involved 138,426 study samples, and algorithm performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), specificity, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among the algorithms tested, the random forest classifier emerged as the top performer in predicting micronutrient supplementation status, exhibiting excellent evaluation scores (AUC = 0.892 and accuracy = 94.0%). By analyzing mean SHAP values and performing association rule mining, we gained valuable insights into the importance of different variables and their combined impact, revealing hidden patterns within the data. Key predictors of micronutrient supplementation were the mother’s education level, employment status, number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, access to media, number of children, and religion. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop targeted strategies to improve the uptake of micronutrient supplementation. Key intervention components involve enhancing education, strengthening ANC services, and implementing comprehensive media campaigns that emphasize the importance of micronutrient supplementation. It is also crucial to consider cultural and religious sensitivities when designing interventions to ensure their effectiveness and acceptance within the specific population. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to explore and experiment with various techniques to optimize algorithm performance, leading to the identification of the most effective predictors and enhanced accuracy in predicting micronutrient supplementation status. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Demographic Health Survey; Machine Learning Algorithms; Micronutrient Supplementation; Pregnant Women; Micronutrients; Trace Element; Adult; Africa; Algorithm; Dietary Supplement; East African; Female; Human; Machine Learning; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Procedures; Young Adult; Adult; Africa, Eastern; Algorithms; Dietary Supplements; East African People; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Micronutrients; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Young Adult","trace element; adult; Africa; algorithm; dietary supplement; East African; female; human; machine learning; pregnancy; prenatal care; procedures; young adult; Adult; Africa, Eastern; Algorithms; Dietary Supplements; East African People; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Micronutrients; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Young Adult",,Micronutrients,,"Corvallis Minerals Micronutrient Information Center, (2018); Ambition and Action in Nutrition 2016 2025, (2016); International Journal of Food Sciences, (2020); Functionality and Application of Colored Cereals Nutritional, (2022); Global Hunger Index the Challenge of Hidden Hunger, (2025); Bailey, Regan Lucas, The epidemiology of global micronutrient deficiencies, Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, 66, pp. 22-33, (2015); Gernand, Alison D., Micronutrient deficiencies in pregnancy worldwide: Health effects and prevention, Nature Reviews Endocrinology, 12, 5, pp. 274-289, (2016); Haider, Batool Azra, Effect of multiple micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and birth outcomes, BMC Public Health, 11, SUPPL. 3, (2011); Karami, Mohammad Mahdi, Global Prevalence of Anemia in Pregnant Women: A Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, Maternal and Child Health Journal, 26, 7, pp. 1473-1487, (2022); Stevens, Gretchen Anna, National, regional, and global estimates of anaemia by severity in women and children for 2000–19: a pooled analysis of population-representative data, The Lancet Global Health, 10, 5, pp. e627-e639, (2022)",,Nature Research,,,,,,20452322,,,39394461,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206123310

However, traditional methods of mineral estimation are complex, time-consuming, expensive, and require technical expertise. This study includes the development of Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS)-based prediction models for predicting five important minerals (Calcium, Copper, Magnesium, Manganese, and Phosphorus) using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Four models, including 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D CNNs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Random Forests (RFs), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were developed and evaluated. The developed 1D CNN model outperformed other considered models in predicting calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus content with RPD (Residual Prediction Deviation) values of 1.75, 1.83, and 2.96, respectively. Whereas, SVR performed best in predicting copper and manganese with an RPD of 1.82 and 2.2, respectively. The 1D CNN model demonstrated R2 (Coefficient of determination) values above 0.65 for all minerals, with a maximum of 0.88 for phosphorus. In addition, the developed models performed superior as compared to the Partial Least Square Regression method (R2= 0.32). The developed models provide efficient tools for rapidly screening perilla germplasm available in global repositories, thus aiding in the selection of mineral-rich genotypes to mitigate micronutrient deficiencies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Germplasm Screening; Machine Learning; Minerals Prediction; Nirs; Perilla Seeds,,,,"This work has been supported by the in-house project of first two authors.

Their susceptibility to nutrient deficiencies poses a significant threat to growth and productivity. Traditional nutrient assessment methods are time and labour-intensive, relying on manual inspection and chemical testing. There has been no significant research on detecting nutrient deficiencies in coconut trees. Additionally, assessing deficiency, and severity automatically and recommending suitable fertilizers remain unexplored. This research leverages the YOLOv9 model to identify macro and micronutrient deficiencies in coconut trees and proposes an Image Analysis based Severity Detection (IASD), to determine the severity of these deficiencies. Along with these a Severity Index Calculation Model (SICM) is also introduced that calculates the Severity Index (SI) of these deficiencies. For each identified deficiency, the appropriate fertilizer and its application quantity are suggested. Four deep learning models—RetinaNet, Faster Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5), and version 9 (YOLOv9) —were compared for the prediction of nutrient deficiencies in coconut trees using a dataset of 5,720 images of nutrient-deficient coconut tree leaves.

However, CB cultivation poses a significant threat to diseases that can drastically reduce yield and quality. Detecting these diseases solely based on visual symptoms is challenging, due to the variability across different pathogens and similar symptoms caused by distinct pathogens, further complicating the detection process. Traditional methods relying solely on farmers’ ability to detect diseases is inadequate, and while engaging expert pathologists and advanced laboratories is necessary, it can also be resource intensive. To address this challenge, we present a AI-driven system for rapid and cost-effective CB disease detection, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning and object detection technologies. We utilized an extensive image dataset collected from disease hotspots in Africa and Colombia, focusing on five major diseases: Angular Leaf Spot (ALS), Common Bacterial Blight (CBB), Common Bean Mosaic Virus (CBMV), Bean Rust, and Anthracnose, covering both leaf and pod samples in real-field settings. However, pod images are only available for Angular Leaf Spot disease. The study employed data augmentation techniques and annotation at both whole and micro levels for comprehensive analysis. To train the model, we utilized three advanced YOLO architectures: YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLO-NAS. Particularly for whole leaf annotations, the YOLO-NAS model achieves the highest mAP value of up to 97.9% and a recall of 98.8%, indicating superior detection accuracy. In contrast, for whole pod disease detection, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 outperformed YOLO-NAS, with mAP values exceeding 95% and 93% recall. However, micro annotation consistently yields lower performance than whole annotation across all disease classes and plant parts, as examined by all YOLO models, highlighting an unexpected discrepancy in detection accuracy. Furthermore, we successfully deployed YOLO-NAS annotation models into an Android app, validating their effectiveness on unseen data from disease hotspots with high classification accuracy (90%). This accomplishment showcases the integration of deep learning into our production pipeline, a process known as DLOps. This innovative approach significantly reduces diagnosis time, enabling farmers to take prompt management interventions. The potential benefits extend beyond rapid diagnosis serving as an early warning system to enhance common bean productivity and quality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Africa; Agriculture; Colombia; Deep Learning; Microbiology; Phaseolus; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Procedures; Virology; Agriculture; Deep Learning; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves,Africa; agriculture; Colombia; deep learning; microbiology; Phaseolus; plant disease; plant leaf; procedures; virology; Agriculture; Deep Learning; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves,,,"The authors express gratitude to the Alliance of Bioversity International and International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Crop Nutrition and Health Division for providing facilities and logistics support.

Their experimental localisation remains a frequent task, but can be resource-intensive and sometimes impossible. Hence, hundreds of studies make use of algorithms that predict a localisation based on a protein’s sequence. Their reliability across evolutionary diverse species is unknown. Here, we evaluate the performance of common algorithms (TargetP, Localizer and WoLFPSORT) for four photosynthetic eukaryotes (Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Physcomitrium patens, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) for which experimental plastid and mitochondrial proteome data is available, and 171 eukaryotes using orthology inferences. The match between predictions and experimental data ranges from 75% to as low as 2%. Results worsen as the evolutionary distance between training and query species increases, especially for plant mitochondria for which performance borders on random sampling. Specificity, sensitivity and precision analyses highlight cross-organelle errors and uncover the evolutionary divergence of organelles as the main driver of current performance issues. The results encourage to train the next generation of neural networks on an evolutionary more diverse set of organelle proteins for optimizing performance and reliability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amino Acid; Proteome; Glycoproteins; Plant Diseases; Random Errors; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii; Diverse Species; Evolutionary Distance; Localisation; Mitochondrias; Performance; Photosynthetic Eukaryotes; Training Sets; Zea Mays; Mitochondria; Amino Acid; Mitochondrial Protein; Proteome; Accuracy; Algorithm; Amino Acid Sequence; Angiosperm; Arabidopsis; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Network; Cell Organelle; Evolutionary Rate; False Positive Result; Gene Sequence; High Throughput Sequencing; Kegg; Mitochondrion; Moss; Nonhuman; Photosynthesis; Plastid; Prediction; Protein Localization; Protein Secondary Structure; Protein Structure; Reliability; Viridiplantae; Whole Genome Sequencing; Zooxanthellae; Bioinformatics; Genetics; Maize; Metabolism; Molecular Evolution; Physiology; Procedures; Protein Transport; Reproducibility; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Evolution, Molecular; Plastids; Protein Transport; Proteome; Reproducibility Of Results","Glycoproteins; Plant diseases; Random errors; Arabidopsis thaliana; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Diverse species; Evolutionary distance; Localisation; Mitochondrias; Performance; Photosynthetic eukaryotes; Training sets; Zea mays; Mitochondria; amino acid; mitochondrial protein; proteome; accuracy; algorithm; amino acid sequence; angiosperm; Arabidopsis; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; cell organelle; evolutionary rate; false positive result; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; KEGG; mitochondrion; moss; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plastid; prediction; protein localization; protein secondary structure; protein structure; reliability; Viridiplantae; whole genome sequencing; zooxanthellae; bioinformatics; genetics; maize; metabolism; molecular evolution; physiology; procedures; protein transport; reproducibility; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Evolution, Molecular; Plastids; Protein Transport; Proteome; Reproducibility of Results",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; Proteome","We thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for grants awarded to SBG (SFB 1208-2672 05415 and SPP2237\u2013440043394).

In this work, we aimed to identify the genetic basis of metabolite functions during harsh environmental conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana. With machine learning algorithms we predicted stress-specific metabolomes for 23 (a)biotic stress phenotypes of 300 natural Arabidopsis accessions. The prediction models identified several aliphatic glucosinolates (GLSs) and their breakdown products to be implicated in responses to heat stress in siliques and herbivory by Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. Bivariate GWA mapping of the metabolome predictions and their respective (a)biotic stress phenotype revealed genetic associations with MAM, AOP, and GS-OH, all three involved in aliphatic GSL biosynthesis. We, therefore, investigated thrips herbivory on AOP, MAM, and GS-OH loss-of-function and/or overexpression lines. Arabidopsis accessions with a combination of MAM2 and AOP3, leading to 3-hydroxypropyl dominance, suffered less from thrips feeding damage. The requirement of MAM2 for this effect could, however, not be confirmed with an introgression line of ecotypes Cvi and Ler, most likely due to other, unknown susceptibility factors in the Ler background. However, AOP2 and GS-OH, adding alkenyl or hydroxy-butenyl groups, respectively, did not have major effects on thrips feeding. Overall, this study illustrates the complex implications of aliphatic GSL diversity in plant responses to heat stress and a cell-content-feeding herbivore. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",(a)biotic Stresses; Aop; Mam; Metabolomics; Quantitative Genetics; Arabidopsis Proteins; Glucosinolates; Cell Culture; Plant Diseases; (a)biotic Stress; Aop; Biotic Stress; Bivariate; Glucosinolates; Heat Stress; Mam; Metabolomics; Plant Response; Quantitative Genetic; Metabolites; Biosynthesis; Breakdown; Feeding; Heat; Mapping; Organizations; Plants; Stresses; Arabidopsis Protein; Glucosinolate; Animal; Arabidopsis; Chromosomal Mapping; Genetics; Heat Shock Response; Herbivory; Metabolism; Metabolome; Phenotype; Physiology; Thysanoptera; Animals; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chromosome Mapping; Heat-shock Response; Herbivory; Metabolome; Phenotype,Cell culture; Plant diseases; (a)biotic stress; AOP; Biotic stress; Bivariate; Glucosinolates; Heat stress; MAM; Metabolomics; Plant response; Quantitative genetic; Metabolites; Biosynthesis; Breakdown; Feeding; Heat; Mapping; Organizations; Plants; Stresses; Arabidopsis protein; glucosinolate; animal; Arabidopsis; chromosomal mapping; genetics; heat shock response; herbivory; metabolism; metabolome; phenotype; physiology; Thysanoptera; Animals; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chromosome Mapping; Heat-Shock Response; Herbivory; Metabolome; Phenotype,,Arabidopsis Proteins; Glucosinolates,"This research is supported by the Perspective Programme \u201CLearning from Nature\u201D of the Dutch Technology Foundation STW, which is part of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) and is partly funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.","Abe, Hiroshi, Function of jasmonate in response and tolerance of Arabidopsis to thrip feeding, Plant and Cell Physiology, 49, 1, pp. 68-80, (2008); Arouisse, Bader, Imputation of 3 million SNPs in the Arabidopsis regional mapping population, Plant Journal, 102, 4, pp. 872-882, (2020); Arouisse, Bader, Improving Genomic Prediction Using High-Dimensional Secondary Phenotypes, Frontiers in Genetics, 12, (2021); Ashraf, Muhammad Arslan, Environmental Stress and Secondary Metabolites in Plants, pp. 153-167, (2018); Bac-Molenaar, Johanna A., Genome-wide association mapping of fertility reduction upon heat stress reveals developmental stage-specific QTLs in Arabidopsis Thaliana, Plant Cell, 27, 7, pp. 1857-1874, (2015); Barrett, Jeffrey Carl, Haploview: Analysis and visualization of LD and haplotype maps, Bioinformatics, 21, 2, pp. 263-265, (2005); Baxter, Ivan R., A coastal cline in sodium accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana is driven by natural variation of the sodium transporter AtHKT1;1, PLOS Genetics, 6, 11, (2010); Bones, Atle Magnar, The myrosinase-glucosinolate system, its organisation and biochemistry, Physiologia Plantarum, 97, 1, pp. 194-208, (1996); Brown, Paul D., Variation of glucosinolate accumulation among different organs and developmental stages of Arabidopsis thaliana, Phytochemistry, 62, 3, pp. 471-481, (2003); Burow, Meike, The Glucosinolate Biosynthetic Gene AOP2 Mediates Feed-back Regulation of Jasmonic Acid Signaling in Arabidopsis, Molecular Plant, 8, 8, pp. 1201-1212, (2015)",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,,,,,09607412; 1365313X,,PLJUE,39316617,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204763297

Additionally, they are an excellent source of protein for both human consumption and animal feed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), found in various leguminous seeds, exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity through diverse mechanisms, including interaction with microbial cell membranes and interference with cellular processes, making them valuable for enhancing crop resilience and food safety. In the field of plant sciences, computational biology methods have been instrumental in the discovery and optimization of AMPs. These methods enable rapid exploration of sequence space and the prediction of AMPs using deep learning technologies. Optimizing AMP annotations through computational design offers a strategic approach to enhance efficacy and minimize potential side effects, providing a viable alternative to conventional antimicrobial agents. However, the presence of overlapping sequences across multiple databases poses a challenge for creating a reliable dataset for AMP prediction. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sequence redundancy across various AMP databases. These databases encompass a wide range of AMPs from different sources and with specific functions, including both naturally occurring and artificially synthesized AMPs. Our analysis revealed significant overlap, underscoring the need for a non-redundant AMP sequence database. We present the development of a new database that consolidates unique AMP sequences derived from leguminous seeds, aiming to create a more refined dataset for the binary classification and prediction of plant-derived AMPs. This database will support the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices by enhancing the use of plant-based AMPs in agroecology, contributing to improved crop protection and food security. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Antimicrobial Peptides (amps); Computational Biology; Database Analysis; Plant; Sequence Redundancy; Nitrogen Fixation; Peptides; Antimicrobial Peptide; Atmospheric Nitrogen; Computational Biology; Database Analysis; Leguminous Crops; Peptide Sequences; Plant; Sequence Redundancy; Sustainable Agriculture; Plant Diseases,Nitrogen fixation; Peptides; Antimicrobial peptide; Atmospheric nitrogen; Computational biology; Database analysis; Leguminous crops; Peptide sequences; Plant; Sequence redundancy; Sustainable agriculture; Plant diseases,,,"Funding text 1: This research was supported by several funding agencies.

The advancement of deep learning algorithms in precision agriculture holds the key to enabling the early classification of plant diseases, thereby leading to enhanced crop yields and ultimately stabilizing food security. In the coarse-grained label discrimination task of weak supervision learning, high-quality semantic features contain abundant semantic description information, which plays a crucial role in constructing a precise description of plant disease discrimination in tanglesome field circumstances and directly influences the performance of neural networks. Thus, a multiattention IBN anti-aliasing neural network (MAIANet) was proposed to improve the classification accuracy of cassava leaf disease classification by improving the feature quality in the coarseness label classification task. The proposed MAIANet neural network includes two innovative approaches. First, the multiattention method was designed to scale the feature signals twice to adjust the angular frequency of the feature signals in the residual branch for optimal feature fitting within the residual unit. Second, the anti-aliasing block extracts the high-frequency component feature and optimizes the quantization result of the pooling operation to depress the aliasing signal in the down-sampled feature maps. When the proposed method was tested and validated on the cassava dataset, the results showed that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method significantly improved, with an accuracy of 95.83 %, a loss of 1.720, and an F1-score of 0.9585, outperforming V2-ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B5, RepVGG-B3g4, and AlexNet with significant margins. Based on the above experimental results, the proposed algorithm is suitable for classifying cassava leaf diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Disease Classification; Feature Fitting Optimization; Multiattention; Quantization Optimization; Aliasing; Disease Classification; Feature Fitting Optimization; Leaf Disease; Multiattention; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Quantisation; Quantization Optimization; Cassava; Genetic Algorithm; Optimization; Precision Agriculture; Signal Processing,Aliasing; Disease classification; Feature fitting optimization; Leaf disease; Multiattention; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Quantisation; Quantization optimization; cassava; genetic algorithm; optimization; precision agriculture; signal processing,,,,"Abadi, Martín, TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning, pp. 265-283, (2016); Abdullahi, Ismail, Effects of cassava genotype, climate and the Bemisia Tabaci vector population on the development of African cassava mosaic geminivirus (ACMV), Acta Agronomica Hungarica, 51, 1, pp. 37-46, (2003); Azeroual, Otmane, Data wrangling in database systems: Purging of dirty data, Data, 5, 2, pp. 1-9, (2020); undefined, (2022); Chang, Dongliang, The Devil is in the Channels: Mutual-Channel Loss for Fine-Grained Image Classification, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 29, pp. 4683-4695, (2020); Chen, Zhuohang, Imbalance fault diagnosis under long-tailed distribution: Challenges, solutions and prospects, Knowledge-Based Systems, 258, (2022); Chen, Junde, Weakly-supervised learning method for the recognition of potato leaf diseases, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, 8, pp. 7985-8002, (2023); Chisenga, Shadrack Mubanga, Progress in research and applications of cassava flour and starch: a review, Journal of Food Science and Technology, 56, 6, pp. 2799-2813, (2019); Choi, Seokeon, Meta Batch-Instance Normalization for Generalizable Person Re-Identification, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3424-3434, (2021); Chollet, François, Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 1800-1807, (2017)",,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,1681699,,CEAGE,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201626889

Leaf diseases caused by climate change and other factors have significantly reduced fruit production. Deep learning methods for segmenting leaf diseases can effectively mitigate this issue. However, challenges such as leaf folding, jaggedness, and light shading make edge feature extraction difficult, affecting segmentation accuracy. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method based on EFS-Former. The expanded local detail (ELD) module extends the model’s receptive field by expanding the convolution, better handling fine spots and effectively reducing information loss. H-attention reduces computational redundancy by superimposing multi-layer convolutions, significantly improving feature filtering. The parallel fusion architecture effectively utilizes the different feature extraction intervals of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer encoders, achieving comprehensive feature extraction and effectively fusing detailed and semantic information in the channel and spatial dimensions within the feature fusion module (FFM). Experiments show that, compared to DeepLabV3+, this method achieves 10.78%, 9.51%, 0.72%, and 8.00% higher scores for mean intersection over union (mIoU), mean pixel accuracy (mPA), accuracy (Acc), and F_score, respectively, while having 1.78 M fewer total parameters and 0.32 G lower floating point operations per second (FLOPS). Additionally, it effectively calculates the ratio of leaf area occupied by spots. This method is also effective in calculating the disease period by analyzing the ratio of leaf area occupied by diseased spots. The method’s overall performance is evaluated using mIoU, mPA, Acc, and F_score metrics, achieving 88.60%, 93.49%, 98.60%, and 95.90%, respectively. In summary, this study offers an efficient and accurate method for fruit tree leaf spot segmentation, providing a solid foundation for the precise analysis of fruit tree leaves and spots, and supporting smart agriculture for precision pesticide spraying. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cnn; H-attention; Leaf Diseases Detection; Parallel Fusion Architecture; Smart Agriculture,,,,,"Shahi, Tej Bahadur, Recent Advances in Crop Disease Detection Using UAV and Deep Learning Techniques, Remote Sensing, 15, 9, (2023); Chin, Ruben, Plant disease detection using drones in precision agriculture, Precision Agriculture, 24, 5, pp. 1663-1682, (2023); Coulibaly, Solemane, Deep learning for precision agriculture: A bibliometric analysis, Intelligent Systems with Applications, 16, (2022); Febrinanto, Falih Gozi, The Implementation of K-Means Algorithm as Image Segmenting Method in Identifying the Citrus Leaves Disease, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 243, 1, (2019); Chodey, Madhuri Devi, Pest detection via hybrid classification model with fuzzy C-means segmentation and proposed texture feature, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 84, (2023); Nagaraj, Jothiaruna, A segmentation method for disease spot images incorporating chrominance in Comprehensive Color Feature and Region Growing, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 165, (2019); Ma, Juncheng, A segmentation method for greenhouse vegetable foliar disease spots images using color information and region growing, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 142, pp. 110-117, (2017); Chen, Chengcheng, Multi-Threshold Image Segmentation of Maize Diseases Based on Elite Comprehensive Particle Swarm Optimization and Otsu, Frontiers in Plant Science, 12, (2021); Xie, Zhenjing, Advancing image segmentation with DBOOtsu: Addressing rubber tree diseases through enhanced threshold techniques, PLOS ONE, 19, 3 March, (2024); Long, Jonathan, Fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 07-12-June-2015, pp. 431-440, (2015)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,,,20734395,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205069619

However, identifying effector proteins remains challenging, in part because they lack common sequence motifs. Here, we introduce Fungtion (Fungal effector prediction), a toolkit leveraging a hybrid framework to accurately predict and visualize fungal effectors. By combining global patterns learned from pretrained protein language models with refined information from known effectors, Fungtion achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. Additionally, the interactive visualizations we have developed enable researchers to explore both sequence- and high-level relationships between the predicted and known effectors, facilitating effector function discovery, annotation, and hypothesis formulation regarding plant-pathogen interactions.

It is a major source of vegetable oil and protein for human consumption, as well as a cash crop for farmers in many regions. Despite the importance of this crop to household food security and income, diseases, particularly Leaf spot (early and late), Alternaria leaf spot, Rust, and Rosette, have had a significant impact on its production. Deep learning (DL) techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated significant ability for early diagnosis of the plant leaf diseases. However, the availability of groundnut-specific datasets for training and evaluation of DL models is limited, hindering the development and benchmarking of groundnut-related deep learning applications. Therefore, this study provides a dataset of groundnut leaf images, both diseased and healthy, captured in real cultivation fields at Ramchandrapur, Purba Medinipur, West Bengal, using a smartphone camera. The dataset contains a total of 1720 original images, that can be utilized to train DL models to detect groundnut leaf diseases at an early stage. Additionally, we provide baseline results of applying state-of-the-art CNN architectures on the dataset for groundnut disease classification, demonstrating the potential of the dataset for advancing groundnut-related research using deep learning. The aim of creating this dataset is to facilitate in the creation of sophisticated methods that will aid farmers accurately identify diseases and enhance groundnut yields. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Disease Detection; Groundnut; Image Classification; Peanut; Precision Griculture; Benchmarking; Classification (of Information); Convolutional Neural Networks; Cultivation; Deep Learning; Food Supply; Image Classification; Learning Systems; Oils And Fats; Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Detection; Food Security; Groundnut; Images Classification; Leaf Disease; Leaf Spots; Peanut; Precision Griculture; Crops,Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Cultivation; Deep learning; Food supply; Image classification; Learning systems; Oils and fats; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Food security; Groundnut; Images classification; Leaf disease; Leaf spots; Peanut; Precision griculture; Crops,,,"Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Ministerio Espa\u00F1ol de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00F3n under projects PID2020-115570GB-C22 MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and PID2023-147409NB-C21 MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, the C\u2010ING\u2010027\u2010UGR23 project and the C\u00E1tedra de Empresa Tecnolog\u00EDa para las Personas (UGR-Fujitsu).

The realm of contemporary agriculture is consistently growing with evolving farming techniques and agricultural innovations. Farmers face challenges in keeping pace with the evolving demands of the planet and meeting the requirements of profitable initiatives, characters, and various other stakeholders. Climate change brought on by industry emissions and soil erosion, soil's nutrient deficiency due to mineral's absence, which results in reduced crop growth, and the cultivation of the same crops repeatedly without trying out new varieties are a few of the difficulties farmers face.

Using two separate metrics, entropy and Gini indexes, the study analyzes well-known procedures with K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) classifier practices. Moreover, the precision under the agriculture paradigm, particularly “crop recommender systems,” includes these methods. Based on the outcomes, the random forest strategy outperforms the other approaches to model accuracy and reliability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Yield Prediction; Decision Tree; Fertilizer; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Climate Change; Crops; Cultivation; Decision Trees; Farms; Machine Learning; Nearest Neighbor Search; Recommender Systems; Crop Yield; Crop Yield Prediction; Economic Forces; Industry Emissions; Learning Strategy; Machine-learning; Random Forests; Soil Erosion; Soil Nutrients; Yield Prediction; Fertilizers,Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Farms; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Recommender systems; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Economic forces; Industry emissions; Learning strategy; Machine-learning; Random forests; Soil erosion; Soil nutrients; Yield prediction; Fertilizers,,,,"International Journal of Computer Science and Software Engineering, (2016); Bang, Shivam, Fuzzy Logic based Crop Yield Prediction using Temperature and Rainfall parameters predicted through ARMA, SARIMA, and ARMAX models, (2019); Bobadilla, Jesús Bobadilla@upm Es, Improving collaborative filtering recommender system results and performance using genetic algorithms, Knowledge-Based Systems, 24, 8, pp. 1310-1316, (2011); Burke, Robin D., Hybrid recommender systems: Survey and experiments, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 12, 4, pp. 331-370, (2002); Chlingaryan, Anna, Machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation in precision agriculture: A review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 151, pp. 61-69, (2018); Geetha, V., An Effective Crop Prediction Using Random Forest Algorithm, (2020); Int J Eng Res Technol Ijert, (2020); International Journal of Engineering Research Technology Ijert, (2021); Johnson, Lisa K., Farmer harvest decisions and vegetable loss in primary production, Agricultural Systems, 176, (2019); Jones, James W., Toward a new generation of agricultural system data, models, and knowledge products: State of agricultural systems science, Agricultural Systems, 155, pp. 269-288, (2017)",,Springer,,,,,,22502106; 22502114,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187864823

As TD symptoms are vague and overlap with other disorders, we aim to identify predictors of recurrent TD and failure to collect B1 labs. Methods: We analyzed a large sample of data from patients with MBS (n = 878) to identify potential predictors of TD risk. We modeled recurrent TD and failure to collect B1 labs using classical statistical and machine learning (ML) techniques. Results: We identified clusters of labs associated with increased risk of recurrent TD: micronutrient deficiencies, abnormal blood indices, malnutrition, and fluctuating electrolyte levels (aIRR range: 1.62–4.68). Additionally, demographic variables associated with lower socioeconomic status were predictive of recurrent TD. ML models predicting characteristics associated with failure to collect B1 labs achieved 75–81% accuracy, indicating that clinicians may fail to match symptoms with the underlying condition. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that both clinical and social factors can increase the risk of life-threatening TD episodes in some MBS patients. Identifying these indicators can help with diagnosis and treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bariatric Surgery; Bayesian Network; Machine Learning; Micronutrient Deficiency; Random Forest; Thiamine Deficiency; Vitamin B1 Deficiency; Alanine Aminotransferase; Ascorbic Acid; Aspartate Aminotransferase; Calcium; Creatinine; Cyanocobalamin; Ferritin; Folic Acid; Glucose; Hemoglobin; Potassium; Protein; Pyridoxine; Sodium; Thiamine; Transferrin; Thiamine; Alanine Aminotransferase; Albumin; Ascorbic Acid; Aspartate Aminotransferase; Calcium; Creatinine; Cyanocobalamin; Electrolyte; Ferritin; Folic Acid; Glucose; Hemoglobin; Potassium; Protein; Pyridoxine; Sodium; Thiamine; Transferrin; Vitamin D; Adult; Article; Bariatric Surgery; Cohort Analysis; Controlled Study; Erythrocyte; Female; Ferritin Blood Level; Hematocrit; Human; Laboratory Test; Low Socioeconomic Status; Machine Learning; Major Clinical Study; Male; Malnutrition; Nutritional Deficiency; Prediction; Recurrent Disease; Retrospective Study; Risk Factor; Roux-en-y Gastric Bypass; Sleeve Gastrectomy; Tertiary Care Center; Thiamine Deficiency; Transferrin Blood Level; Transferrin Saturation; Wernicke Encephalopathy; Wernicke Korsakoff Syndrome; Adverse Event; Blood; Diagnosis; Etiology; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complication; Adult; Bariatric Surgery; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Thiamine; Thiamine Deficiency,alanine aminotransferase; albumin; ascorbic acid; aspartate aminotransferase; calcium; creatinine; cyanocobalamin; electrolyte; ferritin; folic acid; glucose; hemoglobin; potassium; protein; pyridoxine; sodium; thiamine; transferrin; vitamin D; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; cohort analysis; controlled study; erythrocyte; female; ferritin blood level; hematocrit; human; laboratory test; low socioeconomic status; machine learning; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; nutritional deficiency; prediction; recurrent disease; retrospective study; risk factor; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; sleeve gastrectomy; tertiary care center; thiamine deficiency; transferrin blood level; transferrin saturation; Wernicke encephalopathy; Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome; adverse event; blood; diagnosis; etiology; middle aged; postoperative complication; Adult; Bariatric Surgery; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Thiamine; Thiamine Deficiency,,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; cyanocobalamin, 53570-76-6, 68-19-9, 8064-09-3; ferritin, 9007-73-2; folic acid, 59-30-3, 6484-89-5; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; protein, 67254-75-5; pyridoxine, 12001-77-3, 58-56-0, 65-23-6, 8059-24-3; sodium, 7440-23-5; thiamine, 59-43-8, 67-03-8; transferrin, 82030-93-1; Thiamine",,"Morton, John Magaña, First report from the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery closed-claims registry: prevalence, causes, and lessons learned from bariatric surgery medical malpractice claims, Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, 18, 7, pp. 943-947, (2022); Gastric Bypass Malpractice Yields 14 1 Million Verdict Healthcare Risk Mangement, (2022); Bariatric Times, (2018); Cureus, (2021); Timsit, G., Medico-legal claims in bariatric surgery in France between 2010 and 2015, Journal of Visceral Surgery, 156, pp. S51-S55, (2019); Ratnasingham, Kumaran, NHS litigation in bariatric surgery over a ten year period, International Journal of Surgery, 40, pp. 14-16, (2017); Donnino, Michael William, {A figure is presented}Myths and Misconceptions of Wernicke's Encephalopathy: What Every Emergency Physician Should Know, Annals of Emergency Medicine, 50, 6, pp. 715-721, (2007); Frank, Laura Lewis, Thiamin in Clinical Practice, Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, 39, 5, pp. 503-520, (2015); Oudman, Erik, Preventing wernicke encephalopathy after bariatric surgery, Obesity Surgery, 28, 7, pp. 2060-2068, (2018); Smith, Taryn J., Thiamine deficiency disorders: a clinical perspective, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1498, 1, pp. 9-28, (2021)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,,,20726643,,,39064668,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199611113

Plant resistance to Ss pertains to quantitative disease resistance (QDR) controlled by multiple minor genes. Genome-wide identification of genes involved in QDR to Ss is yet to be conducted. In this study, we integrated several assays including genome-wide association study (GWAS), multi-omics co-localization, and machine learning prediction to identify, on a genome-wide scale, genes involved in the oilseed rape QDR to Ss. Employing GWAS and multi-omics co-localization, we identified seven resistance-associated loci (RALs) associated with oilseed rape resistance to Ss. Furthermore, we developed a machine learning algorithm and named it Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis and Machine Learning for Target Gene Prediction (iMAP), which integrates multi-omics data to rapidly predict disease resistance-related genes within a broad chromosomal region. Through iMAP based on the identified RALs, we revealed multiple calcium signaling genes related to the QDR to Ss. Population-level analysis of selective sweeps and haplotypes of variants confirmed the positive selection of the predicted calcium signaling genes during evolution. Overall, this study has developed an algorithm that integrates multi-omics data and machine learning methods, providing a powerful tool for predicting target genes associated with specific traits. Furthermore, it makes a basis for further understanding the role and mechanisms of calcium signaling genes in the QDR to Ss. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calcium Signaling; Gwas; Machine Learning; Quantitative Disease Resistance; Sclerotinia Sclerotiorum; Algorithm; Arabidopsis; Article; Calcium Signaling; Chromosome; Controlled Study; Differential Expression Analysis; Disease Resistance; Gene; Gene Expression; Gene Frequency; Gene Ontology; Genetic Analysis; Genome; Genome-wide Association Study; Genotype; Germplasm; Haplotype; Learning Algorithm; Machine Learning; Multiomics; Nonhuman; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Performance; Phenotype; Phenotypic Variation; Predictive Model; Principal Component Analysis; Promoter Region; Protein Binding; Protein Phosphorylation; Protein Structure; Quality Control; Quantitative Trait Locus; Rapeseed; Sclerotinia Sclerotiorum; Selective Sweep; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Stem Rot; Support Vector Machine; Weighted Gene Co Expression Network Analysis; Ascomycetes; Genetics; Genomics; Immunology; Microbiology; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Procedures; Ascomycota; Brassica Napus; Calcium Signaling; Disease Resistance; Genome-wide Association Study; Genomics; Machine Learning; Multiomics; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci","algorithm; Arabidopsis; Article; calcium signaling; chromosome; controlled study; differential expression analysis; disease resistance; gene; gene expression; gene frequency; gene ontology; genetic analysis; genome; genome-wide association study; genotype; germplasm; haplotype; learning algorithm; machine learning; multiomics; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; performance; phenotype; phenotypic variation; predictive model; principal component analysis; promoter region; protein binding; protein phosphorylation; protein structure; quality control; quantitative trait locus; rapeseed; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; selective sweep; single nucleotide polymorphism; stem rot; support vector machine; weighted gene co expression network analysis; Ascomycetes; genetics; genomics; immunology; microbiology; pathogenicity; plant disease; procedures; Ascomycota; Brassica napus; Calcium Signaling; Disease Resistance; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Machine Learning; Multiomics; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci",,,"This research was funded by the Zhejiang Science and Technology Major Program on Agricultural New Variety Breeding (No. 2021C02064), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. LZ18C140002), and the Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 324CXTD430).","Bolton, Melvin D., Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary: Biology and molecular traits of a cosmopolitan pathogen, Molecular Plant Pathology, 7, 1, pp. 1-16, (2006); Ding, Lina, Sclerotinia Stem Rot Resistance in Rapeseed: Recent Progress and Future Prospects, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 69, 10, pp. 2965-2978, (2021); Phytopathology, (1979); Alkooranee, Jawadayn Talib, Detecting the Hormonal Pathways in Oilseed Rape behind Induced Systemic Resistance by Trichoderma harzianum TH12 to Sclerotinia Sclerotiorum, PLOS ONE, 12, 1, (2019); Khan, Muhammad Azam, Genetic and molecular analysis of stem rot (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) resistance in Brassica napus (canola type), Heliyon, 9, 9, (2023); Liu, Jie, Functional and evolutionary study of MLO gene family in the regulation of Sclerotinia stem rot resistance in Brassica napus L., Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts, 16, 1, (2023); Corwin, Jason A., Quantitative resistance: More than just perception of a pathogen, Plant Cell, 29, 4, pp. 655-665, (2017); Roux, Fabrice, Resistance to phytopathogens e tutti quanti: Placing plant quantitative disease resistance on the map, Molecular Plant Pathology, 15, 5, pp. 427-432, (2014); Wu, Jian, Identification of QTLs for Resistance to Sclerotinia Stem Rot and BnaC.IGMT5.a as a Candidate Gene of the Major Resistant QTL SRC6 in Brassica napus, PLOS ONE, 8, 7, (2013); Wu, Jian, Comparative transcriptomic analysis uncovers the complex genetic network for resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Brassica napus, Scientific Reports, 6, (2016)",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,,,14220067; 16616596,,,39000053,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85198346013

The major portion of the fresh water was consumed by agriculture sector predominantly on irrigation. India has 4% of world's freshwater resources to assist 18% of world population. Unlike USA and China, India takes 2-4 % more water for its agricultural production. Continuous harvesting without the sufficient measurement and provisioning of the soil nutrient may endanger the sustainability of the agriculture. The amount of macro and micronutrients, pH level and water is used to measure the fertility of the soil. In case of soil nutrient deficiency, fertilizers to be added to the soil to maintain the nutrient levels. Most of the farmers apply the fertilizers manually. The right amount of nutrient to be maintained or else it may affect the plant life cycle and reduce the yield. Therefore, there is a need to adopt the advanced technologies in agro irrigation system by applying intelligent systems and services for the effective usage of fresh water and to maintain soil nutrient.

Among the world, grapes are considered as most significant fruit and it comprises various nutrients, namely Vitamin C. However, grape plants suffer with diseases which extremely affect good quality grape yield. The major six general grape leaf disease and pests are brown spot, leaf blight, downy mildew, anthracnose, and black rot, which produces severe economic suffers to grape commerce. Thus, the early detection of grape leaf disease is highly needed to produce healthy grape yield. Moreover, computer vision driven approaches have been employed effectively in modern years for detecting and classifying plants diseases. In this paper, hybrid approach with fuzzy logic and neural network has been proposed to classify the grape leaf disease. The work is further extended to identify whether leaf is affected with pesticide or not and percentages of pesticide is calculated if it is affected with pesticides.

Disease susceptibility during this period can have a profound impact on yields, posing challenges for farmers. Environmental conditions are pivotal in disease occurrence. Unfavorable conditions reduce the likelihood of pathogens infecting vulnerable host plants as temperature and humidity influence pathogen behavior, including toxin synthesis, virulence protein production, and reproduction. Pathogens can lie dormant in the soil until suitable conditions activate them. When the right environment and host plants align, these dormant pathogens can cause outbreaks. Disease prediction becomes possible by analyzing environmental variables. Real-time data collected via strategically placed sensors focused on viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. Results indicated that the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, with a maximum tree depth of 4 and 30 trees per iteration, achieved remarkable performance, yielding an accuracy of 97%. For comparison, the XGBoost model outperformed an 8-layer Backpropagation network with 7 nodes per layer, which achieved 95% accuracy. These findings underscore XGBoost's efficacy in forecasting and mitigating muskmelon plant diseases, offering the potential for improved crop yields and agricultural sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Back Propagation Network; Disease Forecast; Machine Learning Models; Plant Diseases; Xgboost,,,,,"Stanaszek-Tomal, Elzbieta, Environmental factors causing the development of microorganisms on the surfaces of national cultural monuments made of mineral building materials—review, Coatings, 10, 12, pp. 1-19, (2020); Pérez-García, Alejandro, The powdery mildew fungus Podosphaera fusca (synonym Podosphaera xanthii), a constant threat to cucurbits: Pathogen profile, Molecular Plant Pathology, 10, 2, pp. 153-160, (2009); Trecate, L., Effect of temperature on infection and development of powdery mildew on cucumber, Plant Pathology, 68, 6, pp. 1165-1178, (2019); Xin, Xiufang, Pseudomonas syringae: What it takes to be a pathogen, Nature Reviews Microbiology, 16, 5, pp. 316-328, (2018); Buttimer, Colin, Bacteriophages and bacterial plant diseases, Frontiers in Microbiology, 8, JAN, (2017); Cuppels, Diane A., Disease development and changes in the natural Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato populations on field tomato plants, Plant Disease, 83, 8, pp. 759-764, (1999); Jones, Roger A.C., Global plant virus disease pandemics and epidemics, Plants, 10, 2, pp. 1-41, (2021); Giner, Ana, A mutation in the melon Vacuolar Protein Sorting 41prevents systemic infection of Cucumber mosaic virus, Scientific Reports, 7, 1, (2017); Jiang, Yu, A Pedestrian Detection Method Based on Genetic Algorithm for Optimize XGBoost Training Parameters, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 118310-118321, (2019); Gu, Xinping, A novel lane-changing decision model for autonomous vehicles based on deep autoencoder network and XGBoost, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 9846-9863, (2020)",,Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science,,,,,,25024760; 25024752,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185613341

Corn production is highly dependent on the health of the corn plant. Infected plants will decrease corn plant productivity. Usually, corn farmers use conventional methods to control diseases in corn plants. Still, these methods are not effective and efficient because they require a long time and a lot of human labor. Deep learning-based plant disease detection has recently been used for early disease detection in agriculture. In this work, we used convolutional neural network algorithms, namely YOLO-v5 and YOLO-v8, to detect infected corn leaves in the public data set called ‘Corn Leaf Infection Data set’ from the Kaggle repository. We compared the mean average precision (mAP) of mAP 50 and mAP 50-95 between YOLO-v5 and YOLO-v8. YOLO-v8 showed better accuracy at an mAP 50 of 0.965 and an mAP 50-95 of 0.727. YOLO-v8 also showed a higher detection number of 12 detections than YOLO-v5 at 11 detections. Both YOLO algorithms required about 2.49 to 3.75 hours to detect the infected corn leaves. This all-trained model could be an effective solution for early disease detection in future corn plantations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Corn Leaf Disease; Deep Learning; Disease Detection; Yolo Models; Agriculture; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Learning Systems; Plants (botany); Comparison Study; Convolutional Neural Network; Corn Leaf Disease; Corn Plant; Data Set; Disease Detection; Early Disease Detection; Leaf Disease; Yolo Model; Disease Control,Agriculture; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Comparison study; Convolutional neural network; Corn leaf disease; Corn plant; Data set; Disease detection; Early disease detection; Leaf disease; YOLO model; Disease control,,,,"Inspirat, (2022); Rozi, Fachrur, Indonesian market demand patterns for food commodity sources of carbohydrates in facing the global food crisis, Heliyon, 9, 6, (2023); East Java the Largest Corn Producer in Indonesia; Suriani, undefined, The presence of bacterial stalk rot disease on corn in Indonesia: A review, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 911, 1, (2021); Wang, Dashuai, A Review of Deep Learning in Multiscale Agricultural Sensing, Remote Sensing, 14, 3, (2022); Saleem, Muhammad, Automation in Agriculture by Machine and Deep Learning Techniques: A Review of Recent Developments, Precision Agriculture, 22, 6, pp. 2053-2091, (2021); Zhu, Nanyang, Deep learning for smart agriculture: Concepts, tools, applications, and opportunities, International Journal of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, 11, 4, pp. 32-44, (2018); Alzubaidi, Laith, Review of deep learning: concepts, CNN architectures, challenges, applications, future directions, Journal of Big Data, 8, 1, (2021); Jurnal Riset Komputer Jurikom, (2022); Javanmardi, Shima, Computer-vision classification of corn seed varieties using deep convolutional neural network, Journal of Stored Products Research, 92, (2021)",,"Institute for Research and Community Services, Institut Teknologi Bandung",,,,,,23375779; 23385502,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189540449

The challenge lies in the absence of early visible symptoms for timely detection and management. While hyperspectral imaging technologies have been successfully applied to improve screening for some plant health indicators and diseases, they have not yet been successfully used for crown rot disease detection. This study endeavoured to harness hyperspectral imaging technologies for early-stage, high-throughput, accurate, economical, and non-destructive detection of crown rot disease. Four common Australian commercial wheat varieties with different resistance levels were chosen for study, including Aurora, Yitpi, Emu Rock and Trojan. Three different hyperspectral cameras, covering various wavelength ranges, were tested from both side-view and top-view. Four types of input data for support vector machine classification were tested, including reflectance and the other three derived forms namely hyper-hue, standard normal variate, and principal components. The experimental results showed that hyperspectral imaging technologies can successfully diagnose infected plants in a greenhouse approximately 30 days after infection when there were no visible symptoms on shoots, and the hyper-hue and standard normal variate data transformation methods achieved high F1 scores above 0.75. By discovering key wavelengths, we found that hyperspectral imaging achieved early detection by uncovering biological stress related to photosynthetic activities, and limited absorption of water, protein and starch synthesis. These findings represent a critical advance towards establishing a hyperspectral imaging system for crown rot detection, thereby facilitating disease management and breeding resistant varieties. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computer Vision; Crown Rot; Hyperspectral Imaging Technologies; Machine Learning; Plant Phenotyping; Biosynthesis; Computer Vision; Diagnosis; Learning Systems; Machine Components; Metadata; Support Vector Machines; Water Absorption; Crown Rot; Early Diagnosis; Fungal Pathogen; Hyperspectral Imaging Technologies; Machine-learning; Plant Phenotyping; Rot Disease; Standard Normal Variates; Wheat Production; Yield Loss; Hyperspectral Imaging; Computer Vision; Crown Rot; Equipment; Imaging Method; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Protein; Support Vector Machine; Wheat; Aurora [central Luzon],Biosynthesis; Computer vision; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Machine components; Metadata; Support vector machines; Water absorption; Crown rot; Early diagnosis; Fungal pathogen; Hyperspectral imaging technologies; Machine-learning; Plant phenotyping; Rot disease; Standard normal variates; Wheat production; Yield loss; Hyperspectral imaging; computer vision; crown rot; equipment; imaging method; machine learning; phenotype; protein; support vector machine; wheat; Aurora [Central Luzon],,,"Funding text 1: We would like to thank Lidia Mischis, Fiona Norrish, Nicole Bond and other technical staff in Plant Accelerator for excellent technical assistance.

This provides a rich data base for the application of deep learning in biological sequence classification. For predicting and analyzing the biological functions of DNA, RNA, proteins and peptides, sequence-based prediction and analysis play a crucial role. Especially in the field of RNA, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an indispensable role in regulating biological activities, and thus their identification and prediction are important for a deeper understanding of biological processes. In order to achieve more accurate predictions, an improved deep learning model is proposed in this study. The model treats plant lncRNA sequences as natural text, utilizes the BERT model for pre-training, and combines with convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and prediction. The experimental results show that the CNN model trained by BERT exhibits higher accuracy and stability in lncRNA prediction compared with traditional machine learning methods such as SVM, LR, and K-NN. This fully demonstrates the great potential of deep learning methods in biological sequence analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bert; Convolutional Neural Network; Long Noncoding Rna; Plant; Prediction; Adversarial Machine Learning; Convolutional Neural Networks; Plant Diseases; Bert; Biological Functions; Biological Sequences; Convolutional Neural Network; Data Base; Long Noncoding Rna; Neural-networks; Plant; Predicting And Analyzing; Sequence Classification; Prediction Models,Adversarial machine learning; Convolutional neural networks; Plant diseases; BERT; Biological functions; Biological sequences; Convolutional neural network; Data base; Long noncoding RNA; Neural-networks; Plant; Predicting and analyzing; Sequence classification; Prediction models,,,,"Palazzo, Alexander F., Non-coding RNA: What is functional and what is junk?, Frontiers in Genetics, 5, JAN, (2015); Proceedings of Naacl Hlt, (2019); Zhou, Xiaoxu, Interactions and links among the noncoding RNAs in plants under stresses, Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 133, 12, pp. 3235-3248, (2020); Rodríguez, Pau, Beyond one-hot encoding: Lower dimensional target embedding, Image and Vision Computing, 75, pp. 21-31, (2018); Sun, Liang, Utilizing sequence intrinsic composition to classify protein-coding and long non-coding transcripts, Nucleic Acids Research, 41, 17, (2013); Xu, Xinran, A systematic review of computational methods for predicting long noncoding RNAs, Briefings in Functional Genomics, 20, 3, pp. 162-173, (2021); Meng, Jun, lncRNA-LSTM: Prediction of Plant Long Non-coding RNAs Using Long Short-Term Memory Based on p-nts Encoding, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11645 LNAI, pp. 347-357, (2019); Le, Nguyen Quoc Khanh, Classifying Promoters by Interpreting the Hidden Information of DNA Sequences via Deep Learning and Combination of Continuous FastText N-Grams, Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology, 7, (2019)",,Association for Computing Machinery,,"3rd International Conference on Computer, Artificial Intelligence and Control Engineering, CAICE 2024",,Xi'an,201572,,9798400717093; 9798400716898; 9798400709005; 9798400709579; 9798400709302; 9798400717291; 9798400716942,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201372596

All these features make it a healthy addition to a balanced diet. Apples come in a large range of colors, flavors, and varieties. There are several types of diseases both bacterial and fungal along with other types of nutritional and soil diseases that hamper the production of apple crops. A few common types of fungal diseases include Apple rot, rust, and scab. Timely identification and proper treatment can save apple crops in early stages of disease progression, saving the crop and not digging a hole in the pocket of the farmer. Until last century manual identification methods were more popular but they were very laborious, time-consuming, and the accuracy was not up to the mark. 21st century marks the use of machine learning and deep learning in almost all aspects of human life including early identification of disease in several plants including Apple. In this paper authors analyze and evaluate what are the current trends in detection of fungal diseases of Apple plants. Out of several types of Apple diseases three main types were chosen to conduct this review and those diseases are rust, scab, and rot. The primary aim of this review article is to analyze the use of various machine learning tools like CNN (convolutional neural network), support vector machine, and k nearest neighbor for the detection of fruit and leaf diseases under these three plant disease categories of Apple. An early detection will ensure early curative and remedial measures which will save the crop from getting destroyed due to the above diseases and will save the farmer from huge losses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Apple Fungal Diseases; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Rot; Rust; Scab; Deep Learning; Support Vector Machines; Apple Fungal Disease; Dietary Fibre; Disease Detection; Fungal Disease; Machine-learning; Macro-and Micronutrients; Rot; Rust; Scab; Fruits,Deep learning; Support vector machines; Apple fungal disease; Dietary fibre; Disease detection; Fungal disease; Machine-learning; Macro-and micronutrients; Rot; Rust; Scab; Fruits,,,,"Nabi, Firasath, Wireless sensor network in precision farming for forecasting and monitoring of apple disease: a survey, International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore), 14, 2, pp. 769-780, (2022); International Journal of Innovative Research Intechnology, (2023); Kidskonnect Apple Facts Worksheets and Health Benefits Information for Kids, (2017); Zhong, Yong, Research on deep learning in apple leaf disease recognition, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 168, (2020); Asian Research Journal of Current Science, (2021); Jadhav, Sachin Balkrushna, Identification of plant diseases using convolutional neural networks, International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore), 13, 6, pp. 2461-2470, (2021); Jan, Mahvish, Image features based intelligent apple disease prediction system: Machine learning based apple disease prediction system, International Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Information Systems, 11, 3, pp. 31-47, (2020); Bharate, Anil A., A review on plant disease detection using image processing, pp. 103-109, (2018); Proceedings of International Conference on Sustainable Computing in Science Technology and Management Suscom, (2019); Chao, Xiaofei, Identification of apple tree leaf diseases based on deep learning models, Symmetry, 12, 7, (2020)",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"3rd IEEE Delhi Section Flagship Conference, DELCON 2024",,New Delhi,206776,,9798331518592,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219302411

Nevertheless, identification and categorization of nutrient deficiencies in hydroponic lettuce are still challenging, specifically, when training deep learning models for low power 'Edge' IoT devices such as smart mobile phones and Raspberry Pi. Current methods are challenging due to high computational complexity, high power consumption, and inadequate utilization of resources, which hinders real-life implementation in embedded systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents an intelligent, highly efficient approach for the identification of nutrient deficiencies in hydroponic lettuce using advanced algorithms and a Consensus Multi-Dilated Adaptive Network (CMDA-Net). The proposed model harnesses or combines many of the current best-known or best performing approaches to yield a proper feature extraction and classification. This approach takes advantage of deep neural networks including VGG-16, Residual Attention Network (RAN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a multi-dilated convolutional network to improve spatial feature learning while at the same time reducing computational cost. These features are then passed through LSTM network that help capture temporal information control and ensure that lettuce deficiencies are correctly classified. The entire system structure is enhanced through the new Improvised Honey Badger Algorithm (I-HBA), which adjusts specific networks' parameters for maximum effectiveness with minimal resource consumption. Many experiments were carried out on Lettuce NPK dataset which contains test images of Fully Nutritional, Nitrogen Deficient, Phosphorus Deficient and Potassium Deficient lettuce. It respectively assessed the accuracy, specificity rate, precision, NPV, FPR, and MCC of the model. We also gained compelling improvements in terms of both computational time and model accuracy with exactly terminal prediction accuracy 96% and specificity 95%. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ai Embedded Systems In Agriculture; Convolutional Neural Network (cnn); Deficiency Detection Of Hydroponic Lettuce; Efficient Deep Learning; Improvised Honey Badger Algorithm (i-hba); Iot Based Nutrient Monitoring; Long Short-term Memory (lstm); Low Cost Iot Devices; Multi-dilated Consensus Networks (cmda-net); Residual Attention Network (ran); Smart Agriculture; Vgg16; Deep Neural Networks; Elastin; Hydroponics; Long Short-term Memory; Smart Agriculture; Vitamins; Adaptive Networks; Ai Embedded System In Agriculture; Consensus Networks; Convolutional Neural Network; Deficiency Detection Of Hydroponic Lettuce; Efficient Deep Learning; Embedded-system; Improvised Honey Badger Algorithm; Iot Based Nutrient Monitoring; Low Cost Iot Device; Low-costs; Multi-dilated Consensus Network (consensus Multi-dilated Adaptive Network); Network Consensus; Nutrient Monitoring; Residual Attention Network; Short Term Memory; Smart Agricultures; Vgg16; Convolutional Neural Networks,Deep neural networks; Elastin; Hydroponics; Long short-term memory; Smart agriculture; Vitamins; Adaptive networks; AI embedded system in agriculture; Consensus networks; Convolutional neural network; Deficiency detection of hydroponic lettuce; Efficient deep learning; Embedded-system; Improvised honey badger algorithm; IoT based nutrient monitoring; Low cost IoT device; Low-costs; Multi-dilated consensus network (consensus multi-dilated adaptive network); Network consensus; Nutrient monitoring; Residual attention network; Short term memory; Smart agricultures; VGG16; Convolutional neural networks,,,,"IEEE Access, (2019); IEEE Access, (2020); IEEE Internet of Things Journal, (2021); IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, (2019); IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, (2020); IEEE Access, (2021); IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, (2022); IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics Systems, (2020); IEEE Transactions Onfuzzy Systems, (2021); IEEE Internet of Things Journal, (2022)",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"4th International Conference on Power, Energy, Control and Transmission Systems, ICPECTS 2024",,Chennai,205135,,9798331508845,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215504760

It uses more than one mild spectral band in the seen and non-seen stages to seize and analyze pictures with high decision and accuracy. The gadget comprises advanced sensors, algorithms, and software that collectively extract meaningful records from the captured photos. The sensors use an aggregate of filters and lenses to capture photographs in unique spectral bands, which are then processed using specialized algorithms to identify and decorate the precise capabilities of the hobby. This era has several programs in various industries, including agriculture, environmental monitoring, scientific imaging, and defense. Agriculture may be used to discover illnesses and improve crop yield via reading about plant health and vitamins. Environmental tracking can help pick out pollutants and tune modifications in ecosystems.

Soybean (Glycine max), a key contributor to global plant-based protein supplies, requires ongoing yield enhancements to keep pace with increasing demand. Precise, on-plant seed counting and localization may catalyze breeding selection of shoot architectures and seed localization patterns related to superior performance in high planting density and contribute to increased yield. Traditional manual counting and localization methods are labor-intensive and prone to error, necessitating more efficient approaches for yield prediction and seed distribution analysis. To solve this, we propose MSANet: a novel deep learning framework tailored for counting and localization of soybean seeds on mature field-grown soy plants. A multi-scale attention map mechanism was applied to maximize model performance in seed counting and localization in soybean breeding fields. We compared our model with a previous state-of-the-art model using the benchmark dataset and an enlarged dataset, including various soybean genotypes. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on all datasets across various soybean genotypes on both counting and localization tasks. Furthermore, our model also performed well on in-canopy 360° video, dramatically increasing data collection efficiency. We also propose a technique that enables previously inaccessible insights into the phenotypic and genetic diversity of single plant vertical seed distribution, which may accelerate the breeding process.

Unlike other fruit trees, kiwi trees are vine plants that require abundant mineral nutrients during their key growth period. Inadequate management can easily lead to nutrient deficiencies, which not only affect the health of the trees but also impact the yield and quality of kiwis. Therefore, real-time monitoring of tree growth health is essential. To achieve fast and large-scale monitoring of overall growth and health in kiwi orchards, the drone was used to capture multispectral images of orchards, and then Pix4Dmapper software was utilized to splice UAV multispectral images for orthophoto maps and radiation correction on canopy leaves. The segmented orthophoto images were used as samples from 420 regions. The maximum inter-class variance (Otsu) method was employed to segment canopy leaves from soil backgrounds in the sample images, enabling measurement of canopy SPAD values for constructing a multispectral dataset. Firstly, outliers within the dataset were detected by using box plot analysis and subsequently removed as abnormal samples. Next, based on data characteristics derived from multi-channel images, feature values such as change rates between adjacent channels and 23 kinds of common vegetation indices were extracted, as well as their combination, to serve as sample feature values. Then three feature screening algorithms, including CARS, LARS, and IRIV were applied to optimize these features accordingly. Eight modeling methods, partial least square regression (PLSR) , support vector regression ( SVR ) , ridge regression ( RR ) , multiple linear regression ( MLR ) , extreme gradient boosting ( XGBoost) , least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression ( Lasso ) , random forest regression ( RFR) , and Gaussian process regression ( GPR) , were employed to construct models for identifying canopy chlorophyll content in macaque peach orchards. Finally, the performance of the 24 models constructed with different sample features was compared and analyzed. The experimental results showed that GPR model had the best performance among the models based on the change rate of adjacent channels, R2 and RMSE were 0. 770 and 3. 044, respectively. Among the models based on the combination of vegetation index and adjacent channel change rate, GPR model also had the best performance, R2 and RMSE were 0.783 and 2.957, respectively. The XGBoost model based on vegetation index was the best among all models, R2 and RMSE were 0.787 and 2.933, respectively. Consequently, the intelligent detection model utilizing UAV remote sensing enabled accurate assessment of orchard canopy chlorophyll content while facilitating analysis of orchard health status to provide decision support for subsequent intelligent orchard management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Chlorophyll Content; Kiwifruit Orchards; Machine Learning; Multispectra; Uav; Agricultural Robots; Deforestation; Diagnosis; Elastin; Liquid Sugar; Multiple Linear Regression; Orchards; Photomapping; Support Vector Regression; Volatile Fatty Acids; Adjacent Channels; Chlorophyll Contents; Kiwifruit Orchard; Kiwifruits; Machine-learning; Model-based Opc; Multi-spectrum; Multispectral Images; Performance; Vegetation Index; Fruits,Agricultural robots; Deforestation; Diagnosis; Elastin; Liquid sugar; Multiple linear regression; Orchards; Photomapping; Support vector regression; Volatile fatty acids; Adjacent channels; Chlorophyll contents; Kiwifruit orchard; Kiwifruits; Machine-learning; Model-based OPC; Multi-spectrum; Multispectral images; Performance; Vegetation index; Fruits,,,,"Guo, Mingyue, Real-time Production Prediction of Kiwifruit in Orchard Based on Video Tracking Algorithm, Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery, 54, 6, pp. 178-185, (2023); Luo, Anwei, Relationship between Postharvest Physiology, Quality and Electrical Properties of Kiwifruit Infected with Penicillium expansum, Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery, 52, 5, pp. 307-332, (2021); Barman, Utpal, Smartphone image based digital chlorophyll meter to estimate the value of citrus leaves chlorophyll using Linear Regression, LMBP-ANN and SCGBP-ANN, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 34, 6, pp. 2938-2950, (2022); Gitelson, Anatoly A., Relationships between leaf chlorophyll content and spectral reflectance and algorithms for non-destructive chlorophyll assessment in higher plant leaves, Journal of Plant Physiology, 160, 3, pp. 271-282, (2003); Zhang, Lihua, Kinetics of chlorophyll degradation and color loss in heated kiwifruit puree, Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, 28, 6, pp. 289-292, (2012); Wang, Pei, Key technology for remote sensing information acquisition based on micro UAV, Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, 30, 18, pp. 1-12, (2014); Tian, Zhenkun, Rapid crops classification based on UAV low-altitude remote sensing, Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, 29, 7, pp. 109-116, (2013); Li, Bing, Monitoring vegetation coverage variation of winter wheat by low-altitude UAV remote sensing system, Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, 28, 13, pp. 160-165, (2012); Yan, Yuncai, Design of Kiwifruit Orchard Disease and Pest Detection System Based on Aerial and Ground Multi-source Information, Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery, 54, pp. 294-300, (2023); Blackburn, George Alan, Retrieval of chlorophyll concentration from leaf reflectance spectra using wavelet analysis, Remote Sensing of Environment, 112, 4, pp. 1614-1632, (2008)",,Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery,,,,,,10001298,,NUYCA,,Chinese,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205456094

Plants are often considered life savers for humanity, having evolved complex adaptations to cope with adverse environmental conditions. Protecting agricultural produce from devastating conditions such as stress is essential for the sustainable development of the nation. Plants respond to various environmental stressors such as drought, salinity, heat, cold, etc. Abiotic stress can significantly impact crop yield and development posing a major threat to agriculture. SNARE proteins play a major role in pathological processes as they are vital proteins in the life sciences. These proteins act as key players in stress responses. Feature extraction is essential for visualizing the underlying structure of the SNARE proteins in analyzing the root cause of abiotic stress in plants. To address this issue, we developed a hybrid model to capture the hidden structures of the SNAREs. A feature fusion technique has been devised by combining the potential strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with a high dimensional radial basis function (RBF) network. Additionally, we employ a bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network to classify the presence of SNARE proteins. Our feature fusion model successfully identified abiotic stress in plants with an accuracy of 74.6%.

It helps keep crops healthy and makes farming last longer. Tomato leaf diseases are big problems for farmers and the farming business. Some of the key challenges associated with tomato leaf diseases include: Plant diseases in the leaves of tomato plants directly lead to a decrease in crop production. Diseases like early blight, late blight and bacterial wilt cause leaves to fall off too soon. This results in the plant's ability to grow fruit properly. Diseases in leaves can affect tomatoes by decreasing fruit production with weird shapes and marks. This not only makes the food look bad but can also result in people saying no to buying it and making its worth lower. In the proposed work, we proposed a strong ensemble model that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This helps to accurately identify ten different types of tomato leaf diseases using a learning rate of 0.015, our hybrid model gets an accuracy at 99.8%. The model's performance is shown more by a loss value of 0.032, showing how good it is at finding complicated patterns in the data set. This smart method not only shows the strength of mixing LSTM and CNN designs, but it also helps in improving the classification accuracy of tomato leaf disease detection.

MN deficiency is a significant public health problem, especially in developing countries like Ethiopia. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence using advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning. Therefore, this study aimed to use advanced supervised algorithms to predict the micronutrient intake status in Ethiopian children aged 6–23 months. Methods: A total weighted of 2,499 children aged 6–23 months from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data set were utilized. The data underwent preprocessing, with 80% of the observations used for training and 20% for testing the model. Twelve machine learning algorithms were employed. To select best predictive model, their performance was assessed using different evaluation metrics in Python software. The Boruta algorithm was used to select the most relevant features. Besides, seven data balancing techniques and three hyper parameter tuning methods were employed. To determine the association between independent and targeted feature, association rule mining was conducted using the a priori algorithm in R software. Results: According to the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, out of 2,499 weighted children aged 12–23 months, 1,728 (69.15%) had MN intake. The random forest, catboost, and light gradient boosting algorithm outperformed in predicting MN intake status among all selected classifiers. Region, wealth index, place of delivery, mothers’ occupation, child age, fathers’ educational status, desire for more children, access to media exposure, religion, residence, and antenatal care (ANC) follow-up were the top attributes to predict MN intake. Association rule mining was identified the top seven best rules that most frequently associated with MN intake among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia. Conclusion: The random forest, catboost, and light gradient boosting algorithm achieved a highest performance and identifying the relevant predictors of MN intake. Therefore, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop targeted interventions to enhance the uptake of micronutrient supplementation among children. Customizing strategies based on identified association rules has the potential to improve child health outcomes and decrease the impact of micronutrient deficiencies in Ethiopia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Children; Ethiopia; Machine Learning Algorithm; Micronutrient Supplementation; Prediction,,,,,"Tam, Emily W.y., Micronutrient supplementation and fortification interventions on health and development outcomes among children under-five in low-and middleincome countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Nutrients, 12, 2, (2020); Azadbakht, Leila, Macro and micro-nutrients intake, food groups consumption and dietary habits among female students in Isfahan University of medical sciences, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal, 14, 4, pp. 204-209, (2012); Ames, Bruce N., Low micronutrient intake may accelerate the degenerative diseases of aging through allocation of scarce micronutrient by triage, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 103, 47, pp. 17589-17594, (2006); Velasco, Inés, Iodine as essential nutrient during the first 1000 days of life, Nutrients, 10, 3, (2018); Intl Food Policy Res Inst, (2014); Cannell, John Jacob, Cod liver oil, vitamin A toxicity, frequent respiratory infections, and the vitamin D deficiency epidemic, Annals of Otology, Rhinology and Laryngology, 117, 11, pp. 864-870, (2008); Black, Robert E., Maternal and child undernutrition and overweight in low-income and middle-income countries, The Lancet, 382, 9890, pp. 427-451, (2013); Mulat, Efram, Uptake of minimum acceptable diet among children aged 6-23 months in orthodox religion followers during fasting season in rural area, DEMBECHA, north West Ethiopia, BMC Nutrition, 5, 1, (2019); Sazawal, Sunil, Effect of zinc supplementation on mortality in children aged 1-48 months: a community-based randomised placebo-controlled trial, The Lancet, 369, 9565, pp. 927-934, (2007); Jack, Susan J., Effect of micronutrient sprinkles on reducing anemia a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial, Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 166, 9, pp. 842-850, (2012)",,Frontiers Media SA,,,,,,2296861X,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196790980

With the increase in world population, the fruit demand has also increased. However, there are various diseases which affect the health of the grapevine leading to loss in its production. In the present study, a pre-trained and fine-tuned VGG16 model has been implemented for precise and accurate grape leaf disease identification. It is crucial to determine the health and growth of grapevines, but the use of advanced computer vision methods can speed up this process. The VGG16 model extracts deep features from the images and allows a faster and non-invasive performance evaluation. In the proposed work, the significance of grape leaf disease detection in viticulture is examined. The study implements the fine-tuned VGG16 model on a Kaggle-based dataset and examines the performance outcomes. The model's performance results have been identified in terms of accuracy and loss on different numbers of epochs. The results show that with the increase in the epoch count, the accuracy has also increased and reached 98% at epoch 25. The proposed VGG16 model for grape leaf disease recognition is a significant step forward for the viticulture sector, offering a potential approach for automating the evaluation of grape plant health. The proposed work also discusses about the training and testing loss and results that at epoch count 25, the lowest training and testing loss of 0.1466, and 0.1051 have been identified. These findings demonstrate the VGG16 model's effectiveness in identifying grape leaf diseases by demonstrating its precision and potential to improve both the effectiveness and quality of grapevine management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Grapes Leaf Disease; Grapevine Diseases; Precision Agriculture; Vgg16; Deep Learning; Precision Agriculture; Grape Leaf Disease; Grape Leaves; Grapevine Disease; Leaf Disease; Multi-class Classification; Precision Agriculture; Training And Testing; Vgg16; World Population; Fruits,Deep learning; Precision agriculture; Grape leaf disease; Grape leaves; Grapevine disease; Leaf disease; Multi-class classification; Precision Agriculture; Training and testing; VGG16; World population; Fruits,,,,"Padol, Pranjali B., SVM classifier based grape leaf disease detection, pp. 175-179, (2016); Meunkaewjinda, A., Grape leaf disease detection from color imagery using hybrid intelligent system, 1, pp. 513-516, (2008); Xie, Xiaoyue, A Deep-Learning-Based Real-Time Detector for Grape Leaf Diseases Using Improved Convolutional Neural Networks, Frontiers in Plant Science, 11, (2020); Sannakki, Sanjeev S., Diagnosis and classification of grape leaf diseases using neural networks, (2013); Cai, Chuang, Identification of grape leaf diseases based on VN-BWT and Siamese DWOAM-DRNet, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 123, (2023); Huang, Zhaohua, Grape Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Using Machine Learning, pp. 870-877, (2020); Chen, Yiping, Grape leaf disease identification with sparse data via generative adversarial networks and convolutional neural networks, Precision Agriculture, 24, 1, pp. 235-253, (2023); Andrushia, A.

In recent years, agriculture struggles to meet the demand of population of our country which grows rapidly, and various agricultural problems such as pest detection, plant disease detection and classification, soil classification, cultivation of right crops, crop yield prediction, weed detection, environmental prediction, seed quality prediction and classification and animal intrusion detection are the major threats to farmers. An efficient system is required for monitoring agricultural problems and supporting farmers to identify the crops to be cultivated. Soil is the most important for the living of people on our earth which is a root source for agriculture. Farmers are depending on soil for growing crops which is a warehouse of minerals. Soil is of different types in India. Soil properties and the nature of the soil can vary from one location to another location. The same soil properties cannot be found even within a few distances. Each soil can have different levels of minerals, nutrients and organic matter and can have different characteristics based on the location. So, farmers need to know the soil types and features of various kinds of soils to understand which crops are to be cultivated in that particular soil type in different climate conditions and what kind of pesticides and fertilisers can be used for better crop yield. IoT, machine learning and deep learning techniques are emerging techniques and support smart farming.

However, identifying potent AMPs through laborious experimental assays is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address these limitations, this study presents a bioinformatics approach utilizing machine learning models for predicting and selecting AMPs active against plant pathogenic bacteria. Methods: N-gram representations of peptide sequences with 3-letter and 9-letter reduced amino acid alphabets were used to capture the sequence patterns and motifs that contribute to the antimicrobial activity of AMPs. A 5-fold cross-validation technique was used to train the machine learning models and to evaluate their predictive accuracy and robustness. Results: The models were applied to predict putative AMPs encoded by intergenic regions and small open reading frames (ORFs) of the citrus genome. Approximately 7% of the 10,000-peptide dataset from the intergenic region and 7% of the 685,924-peptide dataset from the whole genome were predicted as probable AMPs. The prediction accuracy of the reported models range from 0.72 to 0.91. A subset of the predicted AMPs was selected for experimental test against Spiroplasma citri, the causative agent of citrus stubborn disease. The experimental results confirm the antimicrobial activity of the selected AMPs against the target bacterium, demonstrating the predictive capability of the machine learning models. Discussion: Hydrophobic amino acid residues and positively charged amino acid residues are among the key features in predicting AMPs by the Random Forest Algorithm. Aggregation propensity appears to be correlated with the effectiveness of the AMPs. The described models would contribute to the development of effective AMP-based strategies for plant disease management in agricultural and environmental settings.

Therefore, identification of the genes governing the root traits is an essential research component. With regard to the identification of root-associated genes/proteins, the existing wet-lab experiments are resource intensive and the gene expression studies are species-specific. Thus, we proposed a supervised learning-based computational method for the identification of root-associated proteins. Methods: The problem was formulated as a binary classification, where the root-associated proteins and non-root-associated proteins constituted the two classes. Four different machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and adaptive boosting were employed for the classification of proteins of the two classes. Sequence-derived features such as AAC, DPC, CTD, PAAC, and ACF were used as input for the learning algorithms. Results: The SVM achieved higher accuracy with the 250 selected features of AAC+DPC+CTD than that of other possible combinations of feature sets and learning algorithms.

However, potato plants may suffer from diseases such as early blight, late blight, septoria leaf spot or skin diseases such as greening, silver scurf, common scab, black rot etc. These diseases may lead to huge losses in the potato yield annually. Hence, an early prediction of such diseases is required so that they can be controlled at an early stage. Several machine learning, IoT based and image processing techniques have been utilized for this purpose, and this paper aims to survey all such methods and prediction models. A total of 116 studies were analyzed, and out of them, 77 relevant studies belonging to (60%) journals, (34%) conferences and (6%) other sources have been surveyed. It has been observed that most of the selected studies (64%) have used RGB image data (proprietary or PlantVillage dataset). Also, majority of the studies (48%) have worked with imbalanced data. Late blight and early blight are the two diseases that have gained the most attention by the researchers, being included in 58% and 34% of the studies. Moreover, feature extraction/selection has been used only with image data (RGB and hyperspectral). Convolutional Neural Network is the most widely used classifier, followed by Support Vector Machines. This review will help the researchers gain an insight into the work done for disease detection in potato crop and what techniques or diseases need intervention so that yield losses can further be minimized. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Image Processing; Internet Of Things; Machine Learning; Potato Diseases; Systematic Literature Survey,,,,This work is financially supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) under a project with reference number “DST/Reference.No.T-319/2018-19”.

Like the other plant diseases, grapes plants are also affected some diseases. In order to protect the grapes crop from such diseases, time-to-time monitoring is required. Moreover, some remedies actions can be used at early stages for disease detection. Hence, it is a challenging task to detect grape leaf diseases in their early stages. In this article, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to identify different types of diseases in grape crops. Thereafter, a Gaussian noise features are included during the training, by which an improvement in the training accuracy has been observed. Therefore, an attempt is made to remove overfitting from deep learning model for detecting different grape diseases. Moreover, for training the proposed model, a publicly online available dataset i.e., PlantVillage has been utilized. This dataset is also used for transfer learning or pre-trained CNN models i.e., VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121. Thereafter, the proposed model results are compared with other transfer learning models. Eventually, the proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 99.88%, higher than other transfer learning models. This study concludes that adding the Gaussian noise feature during model training contributes in increasing the accuracy of the deep learning model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Grape Crop Disease Classification; Plant Disease Detection; Plant Disease Recognition; Convolution; Crops; Deep Neural Networks; Gaussian Noise (electronic); Learning Systems; Transfer Learning; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Disease; Deep Learning; Disease Classification; Disease Detection; Grape Crop Disease Classification; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Detection; Plant Disease Recognition; Convolutional Neural Networks,Convolution; Crops; Deep neural networks; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning systems; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural network; Crop disease; Deep learning; Disease classification; Disease detection; Grape crop disease classification; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Plant disease recognition; Convolutional neural networks,,,,"Adeel, Alishba, Diagnosis and recognition of grape leaf diseases: An automated system based on a novel saliency approach and canonical correlation analysis based multiple features fusion, Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems, 24, (2019); International Journal of Computer Applications, (2011); Rangarajan Aravind, Krishnaswamy, Crop disease classification using deep learning approach: an overview and a case study, pp. 173-195, (2020); Krishnaswamy Rangarajan, Aravind, Grape crop disease classification using transfer learning approach, Lecture Notes in Computational Vision and Biomechanics, 30, pp. 1623-1633, (2019); Boufenar, Chaouki, Investigation on deep learning for off-line handwritten Arabic character recognition, Cognitive Systems Research, 50, pp. 180-195, (2018); Budhouliya, Rishabh, Recognition of online handwritten gurmukhi strokes using convolutional neural networks, 2, pp. 578-586, (2020); Cecotti, Hubert, Grape detection with convolutional neural networks, Expert Systems with Applications, 159, (2020); Dhingra, Gittaly, Study of digital image processing techniques for leaf disease detection and classification, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 77, 15, pp. 19951-20000, (2018); Es-saady, Youssef, Automatic recognition of plant leaves diseases based on serial combination of two SVM classifiers, pp. 561-566, (2016); Ferentinos, Konstantinos P., Deep learning models for plant disease detection and diagnosis, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 145, pp. 311-318, (2018)",,Springer,,,,,,13807501; 15737721,,MTAPF,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160264089

These diseases trigger diverse signalling pathways. Specific genes and proteins, are upregulated in response to pathogen invasion, enabling plants to mount targeted defence responses. Understanding these mechanisms highlights opportunities for enhancing disease resistance through breeding and genetic research in legume crops. This paper outlines a procedure for identification of diseases in pulse crops using modern image processing technologies and machine learning techniques. The objective is to build a system that can recognize the common ailments of pulses which would otherwise lead to a huge loss in case of the weeds not being controlled. The system uses a data set of diseased and healthy plants and applies CNN's to classify and predict disease. The findings achieved very encouraging Level of accuracy thus suggesting further work could extend to practical use by farmers in assessing the health of the crops more conveniently. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ascochyta Blight; Cnn; Disease Detection; Downy Mildew; Machine Learning; Aspartame; Contrastive Learning; Federated Learning; Ascochyta Blight; Defense Response; Disease Detection; Downy Mildew; Early Diagnosis; Machine Learning Approaches; Machine-learning; Plant Disease; Powdery Mildew; Signalling Pathways; Adversarial Machine Learning,Aspartame; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Ascochyta blight; Defense response; Disease detection; Downy mildew; Early diagnosis; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Plant disease; Powdery mildew; Signalling pathways; Adversarial machine learning,,,,"International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology Irjet, (2015); Rothe, Prashant R., Cotton leaf disease identification using pattern recognition techniques, (2015); Rastogi, Aakanksha, Leaf disease detection and grading using computer vision technology & fuzzy logic, pp. 500-505, (2015); International Conference on the Use of Mobile ICT in Africa, (2014); Tian, Yuan, Multiple classifier combination for recognition of wheat leaf diseases, Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing, 17, 5, pp. 519-529, (2011); Saleem, Muhammad, Plant disease detection and classification by deep learning, Plants, 8, 11, (2019); Annals of Biology, (2021); Singh, Arti K., Machine Learning for High-Throughput Stress Phenotyping in Plants, Trends in Plant Science, 21, 2, pp. 110-124, (2016); Too, Edna Chebet, A comparative study of fine-tuning deep learning models for plant disease identification, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 161, pp. 272-279, (2019); Mohanty, Sharada Prasanna, Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection, Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, September, (2016)",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"2nd International Conference on Advances in Computation, Communication and Information Technology, ICAICCIT 2024",,Faridabad,207611,,9798331541217,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001428075

In our efforts to uncover the metabolic pathways that contribute to the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves by Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000), we created iPst19, an ensemble of 100 genome-scale network reconstructions of Pst DC3000 metabolism. We developed a novel approach for gene essentiality screens, leveraging the predictive power of iPst19 to identify core and ancillary condition-specific essential genes. Constraining the metabolic flux of iPst19 with Pst DC3000 gene expression data obtained from naïve-infected or pre-immunized-infected plants, revealed changes in bacterial metabolism imposed by plant immunity. Machine learning analysis revealed that among other amino acids, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism significantly contributed to the overall metabolic status of each gene-expression-contextualized iPst19 simulation. These predictions were tested and confirmed experimentally. Pst DC3000 growth and gene expression analysis showed that BCAAs suppress virulence gene expression in vitro without affecting bacterial growth. In planta, however, an excess of BCAAs suppress the expression of virulence genes at the early stages of infection and significantly impair the colonization of Arabidopsis leaves. Our findings suggesting that BCAAs catabolism is necessary to express virulence and colonize the host. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into how plant immunity impacts Pst DC3000 metabolism, and how bacterial metabolism impacts the expression of virulence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amino Acid; Isoleucine; Jasmonic Acid; Amino Acids, Branched-chain; Amino Acids; Bacteria; Gene Expression; Plants (botany); Arabidopsis Leaves; Bacterial Metabolism; Bacterial Pathogens; Branched Chain Amino Acids; Colonisation; Computational Modelling; Genes Expression; Plant Immunities; Pseudomonas Syringae; Virulence Gene; Metabolism; Amino Acid; Branched Chain Amino Acid; Isoleucine; Jasmonic Acid; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Article; Bacterial Colonization; Bacterial Growth; Bacterial Metabolism; Bacterial Virulence; Biomass Production; Carbon Source; Catabolism; Computer Model; Controlled Study; Dna Extraction; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; In Vitro Study; Machine Learning; Metabolic Flux Analysis; Metabolism; Metabolite; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Plant Defense; Plant Growth; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaf; Plant Virus; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; Pseudomonas Putida; Pseudomonas Syringae Pv.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms using random forest (RF) models have been developed for classification, pattern recognition and regression tasks, they are capable of modelling non-linear relationships using a range of datasets, identifying hierarchical relationships, and determining the importance of predictor variables. In this study, we describe a framework for spatial prediction based on RF modelling where inverse distance weighted (IDW) predictors are used in conjunction with ancillary environmental covariates. The model was applied to predict the total concentration (mg kg−1) and assess the prediction uncertainty of 56 elements, soil pH and organic matter content using 466 soil samples in western Kenya; the results of iodine (I), selenium (Se), zinc (Zn) and soil pH are highlighted in this work. These elements were selected due to contrasting biogeochemical cycles and widespread dietary deficiencies in sub-Saharan Africa, whilst soil pH is an important parameter controlling soil chemical reactions. Algorithm performance was evaluated determining the relative importance of each predictor variable and the model's response using partial dependence profiles. The accuracy and precision of each RF model were assessed by evaluating out-of-bag predicted values. The models R2 values range from 0.31 to 0.64 whilst CCC values range from 0.51 to 0.77. The IDW predictor variables had the greatest impact on assessing the distribution of soil properties in the study area, however, the inclusion of ancillary environmental data improved model performance for all soil properties. The results presented in this paper highlight the benefits of ML algorithms which can incorporate multiple layers of data for spatial prediction, uncertainty assessment and attributing variable importance.

As an alternative, this work proposes the use of portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry and machine learning algorithms for rapid and low-cost estimation of macro and micronutrient contents in mineral and organic fertilizers. Four machine learning algorithms were tested. Whole (i.e., as delivered by the manufacturer) (CP) and ground (AQ) samples (429 in total) were analyzed to test the effect of fertilizer granulometry in prediction performance. Model validation indicated highly accurate predictions of macro (N: R2 = 0.92; P: 0.97; K: 0.99; Ca: 0.94, Mg: 0.98; S: 0.96) and micronutrients (B: 0.99; Cu: 0.99; Fe: 0.98; Mn: 0.91; Zn: 0.94) for both organic and mineral fertilizers. RPD values ranged from 2.31 to 9.23 for AQ samples, and Random Forest and Cubist Regression were the algorithms with the best performances. Even samples analyzed as they were received from the manufacturer (i.e., no grinding) provided accurate predictions, which accelerate the confirmation of nutrient contents contained in fertilizers. Results demonstrated the potential of pXRF data coupled with machine learning algorithms to assess nutrient composition in both mineral and organic fertilizers with high accuracy, allowing for clean, fast and accurate quality control. Sensor-driven quality assessment of fertilizers improves soil and plant health, crop management efficiency and food security with a reduced environmental footprint. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Green Analysis; Machine Learning; Macronutrients; Micronutrients; Pxrf; Soil Contamination; Soil Health; Boron; Calcium; Charcoal; Copper; Iron; Magnesium; Manganese; Nitrate; Phosphate; Potassium Chloride; Sulfate; Zinc; Zinc Ion; Cost Estimating; Crops; Farms; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Minerals; Nutrients; Organic Carbon; Quality Assurance; Quality Control; Soil Surveys; Trace Elements; Green Analyse; Machine-learning; Macronutrient; Micronutrient; Mineral Fertilizers; Organic Fertilizers; Portable X-ray Fluorescence; Soil Contamination; Soil Health; X Ray Fluorescence; Soils; Boron; Calcium; Charcoal; Copper; Cuprous Ion; Fertilizer; Iron; Magnesium; Manganese; Mineral; Nitrate; Nitric Acid Derivative; Phosphate; Potassium Chloride; Sulfate; Trace Element; Zinc; Zinc Ion; Algorithm; Fluorescence; Food Security; Machine Learning; Performance Assessment; Soil Pollution; Soil Quality; Article; Cattle Manure; Coffee; Compost; Controlled Study; Learning Algorithm; Manure; Nutrient Content; Optics; Principal Component Analysis; Quality Control; Random Forest; Recursive Feature Elimination; Ricinus Communis; X Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry,Cost estimating; Crops; Farms; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Minerals; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Quality assurance; Quality control; Soil surveys; Trace elements; Green analyse; Machine-learning; Macronutrient; Micronutrient; Mineral fertilizers; Organic fertilizers; Portable X-ray fluorescence; Soil contamination; Soil health; X ray fluorescence; Soils; boron; calcium; charcoal; copper; cuprous ion; fertilizer; iron; magnesium; manganese; mineral; nitrate; nitric acid derivative; phosphate; potassium chloride; sulfate; trace element; zinc; zinc ion; algorithm; fluorescence; food security; machine learning; performance assessment; soil pollution; soil quality; Article; cattle manure; coffee; compost; controlled study; learning algorithm; manure; nutrient content; optics; principal component analysis; quality control; random forest; recursive feature elimination; Ricinus communis; X ray fluorescence spectrometry,,"boron, 7440-42-8; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; charcoal, 16291-96-6; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; magnesium, 7439-95-4; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; nitrate, 14797-55-8; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; potassium chloride, 7447-40-7; sulfate, 14808-79-8; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; zinc ion, 23713-49-7","Funding text 1: This work received support from: Mineral Resource Research Company/Brazilian Geological Service (CPRM), National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), and Minas Gerais State Agency for Research and Development ( FAPEMIG ).

However, diseases caused by agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and phytoplasmas cause considerable economic damage to these crops. Existing methods for cassava disease detection require farmers to seek the assistance of agricultural experts for visual inspection and diagnosis, which is challenging and laborious. Most studies have employed pre-trained convolutional neural networks to detect diseases in cassava leaves. Also, it is essential to design customized deep neural networks specific to the target domain for precise classification. This research proposes a novel deep fusion of two networks, residual channel shuffled attention network and Efficientnet. The first network, RCSANet, was presented to capture contextual information using depthwise separable convolution effectively. It also integrates significant inter-spatial and inter-channel information using the triplet attention module and employs shuffled group convolution to capture features from distinct filter groups. As a result of incorporating the above architectural enhancements, the proposed feature fusion network exhibited better performance than the existing studies. The proposed network was trained on the Kaggle cassava leaf disease dataset with 21,367 samples and yielded a classification accuracy of 93.25%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attention; Deep Learning; Hybrid Features; Multi-path Network; Plant Disease; Agriculture; Classification (of Information); Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Neural Networks; Diagnosis; Information Use; Plants (botany); Viruses; Attention; Deep Learning; Economic Damages; Features Fusions; Hybrid Features; Leaf Disease Detections; Multi-path Network; Multipath; Phytoplasmas; Plant Disease; Convolution,Agriculture; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Information use; Plants (botany); Viruses; Attention; Deep learning; Economic damages; Features fusions; Hybrid features; Leaf disease detections; Multi-path network; Multipath; Phytoplasmas; Plant disease; Convolution,,,,"Abayomi-Alli, Olusola Oluwakemi, Cassava disease recognition from low-quality images using enhanced data augmentation model and deep learning, Expert Systems, 38, 7, (2021); undefined, (2014); Ayu, H.

While collecting a representative number of soil samples is time consuming and expensive, digital soil mapping could provide maps of soil properties fast and reliably. The objective of this research was to predict the spatial distribution of soil micronutrients within the piedmont plain in northeastern Iran using random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms. Sixty-eight locations with different land uses were sampled to determine the content of iron, manganese, zinc and copper in the topsoil (0–20 cm). Forty-one digital covariates were used as input to the models and were derived from a digital elevation model, open-source remote sensing (RS) data (Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A MSI images), WorldClim climate database and maps of soil properties. Covariates were grouped into 11 scenarios: I–III, based on RS data; IV–VI, including RS, topographic, climate and soil covariates; VII, VIII and IX, based only on topographic, climate and soil covariates, respectively; X and XI, based on recursive feature elimination and expert opinion, respectively. The RF algorithm gave 91, 94, 91 and 108% normalized root mean squared error values for iron, manganese, zinc and copper, respectively, for the validation dataset with scenario XI. The most important digital covariates for micronutrients prediction with both RF and SVR models were precipitation seasonality, mean annual temperature and the mean saturation index based on Sentinel 2A MSI data. Digital maps produced at 30 m spatial resolution using scenario XI could be used to effectively identify micronutrient deficiencies and excess hotspots. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Arid Regions; Digital Soil Mapping; Expert Opinion; Feature Selection; Remote Sensing; Algorithm; Arid Region; Covariance Analysis; Digital Mapping; Landsat; Machine Learning; Prediction; Remote Sensing; Satellite Data; Sentinel; Soil Nutrient; Spatial Analysis; Trace Element; Iran,algorithm; arid region; covariance analysis; digital mapping; Landsat; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; soil nutrient; spatial analysis; trace element; Iran,,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Department of Soil Science, University of Tehran, Iran (research project no. 4886791).","Adhikari, Kabindra, Topographic Controls on Soil Nutrient Variations in a Silvopasture System, Agrosystems, Geosciences and Environment, 1, 1, pp. 1-15, (2018); Heavy Metals in Soils, (1995); Dataset © Jaxa Meti Alos Palsar L1 0 2007, (2021); Azizi, Kamran, Predicting heavy metal contents by applying machine learning approaches and environmental covariates in west of Iran, Journal of Geochemical Exploration, 233, (2022); Bagherzadeh, Ali, Land suitability modeling by parametric-based neural networks and fuzzy methods for soybean production in a semi-arid region, Modeling Earth Systems and Environment, 2, 2, (2016); Scheffer Schachtschabel Soil Science, (2016); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Soil Survey Manual, (2017); undefined, (2021); Carslaw, David C., Openair - An r package for air quality data analysis, Environmental Modelling and Software, 27-28, pp. 52-61, (2012)",,Institute for Ionics,,,,,,15730867; 13851314,,FRESD,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167798248

Previous studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have shown the critical roles of the CAM-BINDING PROTEIN 60 (CBP60) protein family in plant growth, stress responses, and immunity. Certain CBP60 factors can regulate plant immune responses, like pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity, and synthesis of major plant immune-activating metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). Although homologous CBP60 sequences have been identified in the plant kingdom, their function and regulation in most species remain unclear. In this paper, we specifically characterized 11 members of the CBP60 family in the agriculturally important crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Protein sequence analyses revealed that three CBP60 homologs have the closest amino acid identity to Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1, master transcription factors involved in plant immunity. Strikingly, AlphaFold deep learning–assisted prediction of protein structures highlighted close structural similarity between these tomato and Arabidopsis CBP60 homologs. Conserved domain analyses revealed that they possess CAM-binding domains and DNA-binding domains, reflecting their potential involvement in linking Ca2+ signaling and transcriptional regulation in tomato plants. In terms of their gene expression profiles under biotic (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 pathogen infection) and/or abiotic stress (warming temperatures), five tomato CBP60 genes were pathogen-responsive and temperature-sensitive, reminiscent of Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1. Overall, we present a genome-wide identification of the CBP60 gene/protein family in tomato plants, and we provide evidence on their regulation and potential function as Ca2+-sensing transcriptional regulators. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alphafold; Climate Change; Gene Expression; Gene Regulation; Plant Defense; Plant Immunity; Pseudomonas Syringae; Salicylic Acid; Temperature; Tomato; Transcription Factor; Calcium; Salicylic Acid; Arabidopsis Proteins; Calcium; Calmodulin; Calmodulin-binding Proteins; Salicylic Acid; Transcription Factors; Calmodulin Binding Protein; Calmodulin Binding Protein 60; Unclassified Drug; Arabidopsis Protein; Calcium; Calmodulin; Salicylic Acid; Transcription Factor; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Article; Calcium Signaling; Cbp60 Gene; Controlled Study; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Identification; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Plant Gene; Plant Growth; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaf; Plant Structures; Pseudomonas Syringae Pv.

In agriculture, plant diseases are mainly responsible for production degradation, which causes economic loss. In plants, citrus is widely utilized as a critical resource of nutrients such as vitamin C. But Citrus disease negatively impacts the quality and production of citrus fruits. Over the last few years, image processing and computer vision technologies have been extensively applied to detect and classify diseases in plants. Mostly, plant disease has clear signs, and today's recognized model is for an expert plant diagnostician to recognize the disease by observing a diseased plant leaf through a microscope. Manual disease detection can be labour-intensive and the efficiency of the diagnoses is associated with the pathologist's skills, which makes this a greater application field for computer-aided diagnosis systems. This work develops an effectual Duck Optimization with Enhanced Capsule Network Based Citrus Disease Detection for Sustainable Crop Management (DOECN-CDDCM) technique. The presented technique majorly focuses on the detection and classification of citrus diseases. In the presented approach, several stages of preprocessing are performed. In addition, the duck optimization algorithm (DOA) with the Enhanced Capsule Network (ECN) model is exploited as a feature extractor, and the optimal hyperparameter tuning process helps obtain enhanced performance. Finally, the deep stacked sparse autoencoder (DSSAE) model is utilized for citrus disease detection and classification. A series of simulations were performed to ensure the enhanced disease detection performance of the DOECN-CDDCM algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate the improvised outcomes of the DOECN-CDDCM algorithm than other current techniques. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Citrus Diseases; Crop Management; Deep Learning; Intelligent Systems; Sustainable Agriculture; Citrus Fruits; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Crops; Deep Learning; Image Processing; Losses; Citrus Disease; Citrus Disease Detection; Crop Managements; Disease Detection; Network-based; Optimisations; Plant Disease; Productive Capacity; Sustainable Agriculture; Intelligent Systems; Agriculture; Alternative Agriculture; Natural Resource; Nutrient; Optimization; Vitamin,Citrus fruits; Computer aided diagnosis; Crops; Deep learning; Image processing; Losses; Citrus disease; Citrus disease detection; Crop managements; Disease detection; Network-based; Optimisations; Plant disease; Productive capacity; Sustainable agriculture; Intelligent systems; agriculture; alternative agriculture; natural resource; nutrient; optimization; vitamin,,,,"Doh, Benjamin, Automatic citrus fruit disease detection by phenotyping using machine learning, (2019); Sathian, Dananjayan, Assessment of state-of-the-art deep learning based citrus disease detection techniques using annotated optical leaf images, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 193, (2022); Iqbal, Zahid, An automated detection and classification of citrus plant diseases using image processing techniques: A review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 153, pp. 12-32, (2018); Khanramaki, Morteza, Citrus pests classification using an ensemble of deep learning models, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 186, (2021); Kukreja, Vinay, A Deep Neural Network based disease detection scheme for Citrus fruits, pp. 97-101, (2020); Rauf, Hafiz Tayyab, A citrus fruits and leaves dataset for detection and classification of citrus diseases through machine learning, Data in Brief, 26, (2019); Luaibi, Ahmed R., Detection of citrus leaf diseases using a deep learning technique, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 11, 2, pp. 1719-1727, (2021); Dhiman, Poonam, A Novel Deep Learning Model for Detection of Severity Level of the Disease in Citrus Fruits, Electronics (Switzerland), 11, 3, (2022); Saini, Ashok Kumar, AI based automatic detection of citrus fruit and leaves diseases using deep neural network model, Journal of Discrete Mathematical Sciences and Cryptography, 24, 8, pp. 2181-2193, (2021); Global Transitions Proceedings, (2022)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,22131388,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166619630

These pathogens are major contributors to loss in numerous food crops. Oomycetes secrete effector proteins tomanipulate their hosts to the advantage of the pathogen. Plants have evolved to recognize effectors, resulting in an evolutionary cycle of defense and counter-defense in plant-microbe interactions. This selective pressure results in highly diverse effector sequences that can be difficult to computationally identify using only sequence similarity. We developed a novel effector prediction tool, EffectorO, that uses two complementary approaches to predict effectors in oomycete pathogen genomes: i) amachine learning-based pipeline that predicts effector probability based on the biochemical properties of the N-Terminal amino-Acid sequence of a protein and ii) a pipeline based on lineage specificity to find proteins that are unique to one species or genus, a sign of evolutionary divergence due to adaptation to the host.We tested EffectorO on Bremia lactucae, which causes lettuce downymildew, and Phytophthora infestans,which causes late blight of potato and tomato, and predicted many novel effector candidates while recovering the majority of known effector candidates. EffectorO will be useful for discovering novel families of oomycete effectors without relying on sequence similarity to known effectors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bioinformatics; Bremia Lactucae; Comparative Genomics; Effector Prediction; Oomycete Pathogens; Phytophthora Infestans; Protein; Proteins; Protein; Evolution; Genetics; Genome; Metabolism; Oomycetes; Peronospora; Phytophthora Infestans; Plant; Plant Disease; Biological Evolution; Genome; Plant Diseases; Plants; Proteins,protein; evolution; genetics; genome; metabolism; Oomycetes; Peronospora; Phytophthora infestans; plant; plant disease; Biological Evolution; Genome; Plant Diseases; Plants; Proteins,,"protein, 67254-75-5; Proteins",Funding: Funding was provided by a United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture AFRI predoctoral fellowship to K.

It is important to predict mineral content in contaminated rice rapidly. In this study, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied to quantify minerals (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, and Na) in rice leaves under chromium (Cr) stress. Two feature extraction methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were compared to identify important variables that related to mineral concentrations. Results showed that partial least square regression (PLSR) achieved good performance in Ca, Fe Mg, K, Mn, and Na, with correlation coefficient of 0.9782, 0.8712, 0.8933, 0.9206, 0.9856, and 0.9865, root mean square error of 219.25, 14.78, 1192.47, 385.12, 9.56, and 124.32 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, the correlation between different spectral lines were further analyzed. Cr exhibited a positive correlation with Ca, Mg, and Na, and a negative correlation with Mn, Cu, and K. The proposed method provides a high-accuracy and fast approach for minerals prediction in rice leaves under Cr stress, which is important for environmental protection and food safety. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Chemometric Method;

At present, it is difficult to diagnose rice fungal diseases at an early stage using relevant technologies, and there are a lack of rapid detection methods. This study proposes a microfluidic chip-based method combined with microscopic hyperspectral detection of rice fungal disease spores. First, a microfluidic chip with a dual inlet and three-stage structure was designed to separate and enrich Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores in air. Then, the microscopic hyperspectral instrument was used to collect the hyperspectral data of the fungal disease spores in the enrichment area, and the competitive adaptive reweighting algorithm (CARS) was used to screen the characteristic bands of the spectral data collected from the spores of the two fungal diseases. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to build the full-band classification model and the CARS filtered characteristic wavelength classification model, respectively. The results showed that the actual enrichment efficiency of the microfluidic chip designed in this study on Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores was 82.67% and 80.70%, respectively. In the established model, the CARS-CNN classification model is the best for the classification of Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores, and its F1-core index can reach 0.960 and 0.949, respectively. This study can effectively isolate and enrich Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores, providing new methods and ideas for early detection of rice fungal disease spores. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification Method; Micro-hyperspectral; Microfluidic Chip; Rice Fungal Spores; Polyvinylchloride; Multiphysics 6.0; Soildworks 2021; Polymer; Polyvinylchloride; Agricultural Production; Airflow; Algorithm; Article; Aspergillus Oryzae; Centrifugation; Chlamydospore; Classification; Classification Model; Classifier; Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling; Competitive Adaptive Reweighting Algorithm; Controlled Study; Convolutional Neural Network; Density; Enrichment Efficiency; Fungus Spore; Image Processing; Incubation Time; Magnaporthe Grisea; Mathematical Parameters; Microchannel; Microfluidic Chip Channel Velocity Distribution; Microfluidics; Microhyperspectral Technique; Microscopic Hyperspectral Detection; Mycosis; Nanofabrication; Nonhuman; Numerical Simulation; Optical Transparency; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Process Optimization; Processing Technology; Protein Secondary Structure; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Relaxation Time; Reynolds Number; Rice Fungus Spore; Sensitivity Analysis; Signal Noise Ratio; Spatial Orientation; Spore Suspension; Support Vector Machine; Two Dimensional Structure; Ustilaginoidea Virens; Velocity; Viscosity; Viscosity Coefficient Of Air Flow; Hypocreales; Microbiology; Oryza; Plant Disease; Microfluidics; Plant Diseases; Spores, Fungal","polymer; polyvinylchloride; agricultural production; airflow; algorithm; Article; Aspergillus oryzae; centrifugation; chlamydospore; classification; classification model; classifier; competitive adaptive reweighted sampling; competitive adaptive reweighting algorithm; controlled study; convolutional neural network; density; enrichment efficiency; fungus spore; image processing; incubation time; Magnaporthe grisea; mathematical parameters; microchannel; microfluidic chip channel velocity distribution; microfluidics; microhyperspectral technique; microscopic hyperspectral detection; mycosis; nanofabrication; nonhuman; numerical simulation; optical transparency; polymerase chain reaction; process optimization; processing technology; protein secondary structure; receiver operating characteristic; relaxation time; reynolds number; rice fungus spore; sensitivity analysis; signal noise ratio; spatial orientation; spore suspension; support vector machine; two dimensional structure; Ustilaginoidea virens; velocity; viscosity; viscosity coefficient of air flow; Hypocreales; microbiology; Oryza; plant disease; Microfluidics; Plant Diseases; Spores, Fungal",,"polyvinylchloride, 9002-86-2","This research was funded by the following: Project of Agricultural Equipment Department of Jiangsu University (NZXB20210106).

Its early detection is crucial for suppressing disease spread. Necrotic lesions are normally seen in leaves at 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) when colonized cells are dead, but early detection of the initial biotrophic growth stage, when the pathogen feeds on living cells, is challenging. Here, the biotrophic growth phase of P. infestans was detected by whole-plant redox imaging of potato plants expressing chloroplast-targeted reduction–oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (chl-roGFP2). Clear spots on potato leaves with a lower chl-roGFP2 oxidation state were detected as early as 2 dpi, before any visual symptoms were recorded. These spots were particularly evident during light-to-dark transitions, and reflected the mislocalization of chl-roGFP2 outside the chloroplasts. Image analysis based on machine learning enabled systematic identification and quantification of spots, and unbiased classification of infected and uninfected leaves in inoculated plants. Comparing redox with chlorophyll fluorescence imaging showed that infected leaf areas that exhibit mislocalized chl-roGFP2 also showed reduced non-photochemical quenching and enhanced quantum PSII yield (ΦPSII) compared with the surrounding leaf areas. The data suggest that mislocalization of chloroplast-targeted proteins is an efficient marker of late blight infection, and demonstrate how it can be utilized for non-destructive monitoring of the disease biotrophic stage using whole-plant redox imaging. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Chloroplast; Late Blight; Phytophthora Infestans; Potato; Redox Imaging; Rogfp2; Technical Advance; Plants (botany); Proteins; Cell/b.e; Chloroplast; Late Blight; Phytophthora Infestans; Post Inoculation; Potato; Redox Imaging; Rogfp2; Technical Advances; Whole Plants; Fluorescence Imaging; Cells; Classification; Detection; Growth; Inoculation; Leaves; Plants; Plant Disease; Potato; Plant Diseases; Solanum Tuberosum,Plants (botany); Proteins; Cell/B.E; Chloroplast; Late blight; Phytophthora infestans; Post inoculation; Potato; Redox imaging; Rogfp2; Technical advances; Whole plants; Fluorescence imaging; Cells; Classification; Detection; Growth; Inoculation; Leaves; Plants; plant disease; potato; Plant Diseases; Solanum tuberosum,,,This research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (No. 827/17) and ICA in Israel foundation.,"Abramovitch, Robert B., Strategies used by bacterial pathogens to suppress plant defenses, Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 7, 4, pp. 356-364, (2004); Albrecht, Simone C., In vivo mapping of hydrogen peroxide and oxidized glutathione reveals chemical and regional specificity of redox homeostasis, Cell Metabolism, 14, 6, pp. 819-829, (2011); Awad, Jasmin, 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins and thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase create awater-water cycle that is essential to protect the photosynthetic apparatus under high light stress conditions, Plant Physiology, 167, 4, pp. 1592-1603, (2015); Baldeck, Claire A., Improving remote species identification through efficient training data collection, Remote Sensing, 6, 4, pp. 2682-2698, (2014); Ball, Louise, Evidence for a direct link between glutathione biosynthesis and stress defense gene expression in arabidopsis W inside a box sign, Plant Cell, 16, 9, pp. 2448-2462, (2004); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., A novel algorithm for semi-automatic segmentation of plant leaf disease symptoms using digital image processing, Tropical Plant Pathology, 41, 4, pp. 210-224, (2016); Berger, Susanne, Complex regulation of gene expression, photosynthesis and sugar levels by pathogen infection in tomato, Physiologia Plantarum, 122, 4, pp. 419-428, (2004); Berger, Susanne, Plant physiology meets phytopathology: Plant primary metabolism and plant-pathogen interactions, Journal of Experimental Botany, 58, 15-16, pp. 4019-4026, (2007); Abiotic Stress Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, (2007); Bonfig, Katharina B., Infection with virulent and avirulent P. syringae strains differentially affects photosynthesis and sink metabolism in Arabidopsis leaves, Planta, 225, 1, pp. 1-12, (2006)",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,,,,,09607412; 1365313X,,PLJUE,36534114,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147225654

Plant diseases destroy the overall quality and quantity of agricultural products. Grape is an important fruit and a major source of vitamin C nutrients. The automatic decision-making system plays a paramount role in agricultural informatics. This paper aims to detect the diseases in grape leaves using convolutional capsule networks. The capsule network is a promising neural network in deep learning. This network uses a group of neurons as capsules and effectively represents spatial information of features. The novelty of the proposed work relies on the addition of convolutional layers before the primary caps layer, which indirectly decreases the number of capsules and speeds up the dynamic routing process. The proposed method has experimented with augmented and non-augmented datasets. It effectively detects the diseases of grape leaves with an accuracy of 99.12%.

Nevertheless, the spread of many diseases poses a significant risk to both the quantity and quality of soybean harvests. The timely and accurate categorization of diseases is crucial for the successful implementation of crop management strategies. This study aims to enhance the categorization of soybean diseases by addressing ten different disease classes using the ResNet50V2 deep learning model. In order to accomplish this objective, the Soybean Disease Leaf Image Classification Dataset has been employed for both the purposes of training as well as evaluating the model. The ResNet50V2 model's architectural depth and inclusion of skip connections augment its capacity to grasp complicated patterns present in leaf images, hence bolstering its efficacy in performing robust categorization. The experimental findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of our methodology since the model attains a notable training accuracy of 97% and validation accuracy rate of 96% when diagnosing illnesses in soybean plant leaves with a minimum loss of 0.05 and 0.38.

The traditional approach of detecting leaf diseases in fruit plants requires farmers to undertake manual inspection which exhibits a lack of reliability and consistency. Moreover, the manual inspection procedure is prone to errors due to its reliance on the farmer's knowledge and skill. Mango referred to as the ""king of all fruits"", is renowned for its rich composition of various vitamins and vital nutrients. Mangoes are susceptible to many diseases that adversely damage their visual appeal, and flavor, and have significant implications on the overall economy. The identification of diseases affecting mango plant leaves using automated recognition remains a challenge due to the diverse range of symptoms and limited availability of data. There have been several deep learning-based research studies focused on identifying diseases in mango leaves; however, the majority of these studies have employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a small number of data. This study presents a Vision Transformer (ViT) based approach to detect diseases in mango leaves using publicly available data namely MangoLeafBD. The ViT model has been selected as the detection model due to its parameter efficiency compared to deep CNN models. The ViT has produced remarkable overall classification accuracy of 100%, precision of 100%, recall of 100%, and f1-score of 100% for disease detection on mango leaves which is better than the existing CNN approaches on the MangoLeafBD dataset. This demonstrates that our approach has the potential to assist farmers in the field by providing automated, simple, and more reliable mango leaf disease diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Image Classification; Mango Leaf Disease; Vision Transformer (vit); Classification (of Information); Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Image Classification; Plants (botany); Convolutional Neural Network; Fresh Food; Fruit Crops; Images Classification; Leaf Disease; Mango Leaf Disease; Manual Inspection; Plant Disease; Vision Transformer; Fruits,Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image classification; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Fresh food; Fruit crops; Images classification; Leaf disease; Mango leaf disease; Manual inspection; Plant disease; Vision transformer; Fruits,,,,"Xxix International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture Sustaining Lives Livelihoods and Landscapes Ihc2014 IV 1111, (2014); Mia, Md Rasel, Mango leaf disease recognition using neural network and support vector machine, Iran Journal of Computer Science, 3, 3, pp. 185-193, (2020); Strange, Richard N., Plant disease: A threat to global food security, Annual Review of Phytopathology, 43, pp. 83-116, (2005); Plant Disease, (1995); Proceedings of the 3rd Intl Mango Symposium Darwin 1989 Acta Hortic, (1991); An Intelligent System for Detecting Mediterranean Fruit Fly Medfly Ceratitis Capitata Wiedemann, (2023); VII International Mango Symposium, (2002); Ahmed, Sarder Iftekhar, MangoLeafBD: A comprehensive image dataset to classify diseased and healthy mango leaves, Data in Brief, 47, (2023); Chen, Chunfu, CrossViT: Cross-Attention Multi-Scale Vision Transformer for Image Classification, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 347-356, (2021); Identification and Classification of Leaf Pests within the Indonesian Mango Farms Using Machine Learning, (2021)",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"26th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology, ICCIT 2023",,Cox's Bazar,197664,,9798350359015,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187357014

Cotton crops play a vital role in India. Every year, due to the attack of diseases, cotton production is decreasing. The main reasons for disease in plants are the pests, insects, and pathogens used; if they are not controlled on time, they affect productivity. In advancing digital image processing technologies, machine learning and other techniques that identify early disease detection in plants are proposed. This paper focuses on improving disease detection in cotton crop plants and leaves. Machine learning is used to identify and predict cotton plant disease using images and leaves collected in an uncontrolled environment. This study uses machine learning to review the different problems identified regarding plant disease. Various experimental configurations are investigated to analyze the impacts of different leaf classes, plant disease combinations, and their categories. Cotton crops are detected to classify the various types of cotton plants. Cotton plant diseases have a wide range of illnesses, from bacterial deficiency to bacterial, fungal, viral, and vitamin and nutrient deficiency.

Effective implementation of programs aimed at reducing MN deficiencies requires an understanding of the important drivers of suboptimal MN intake. Therefore, this study aimed to identify important predictors of MN deficiency among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia using machine learning algorithms. Methods: This study employed data from the 2019 Ethiopia Mini Demographic and Health Survey (2019 EMDHS) and included a sample of 1,455 children aged 6–23 months for analysis. Machine Learning (ML) methods including, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Naïve Bayes (NB) were used to prioritize risk factors for MN deficiency prediction. Performance metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves were used to evaluate model prediction performance. Results: The prediction performance of the RF model was the best performing ML model in predicting child MN deficiency, with an AUROC of 80.01% and accuracy of 72.41% in the test data. The RF algorithm identified the eastern region of Ethiopia, poorest wealth index, no maternal education, lack of media exposure, home delivery, and younger child age as the top prioritized risk factors in their order of importance for MN deficiency prediction. Conclusion: The RF algorithm outperformed other ML algorithms in predicting child MN deficiency in Ethiopia. Based on the findings of this study, improving women’s education, increasing exposure to mass media, introducing MN-rich foods in early childhood, enhancing access to health services, and targeted intervention in the eastern region are strongly recommended to significantly reduce child MN deficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Auroc; Child Micronutrient Deficiency; Ethiopia; Machine Learning; Spatial Variation,,,,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

However, the degree of complexity in different body fluids and the presence of a large number of proteins in fluids can make studying them with existing proteomics techniques complex and result in large discrepancies between experimental studies. To address this, we developed a deep learning framework called SecBert that identifies secreted proteins in two human body fluids. SecBert uses a sequence-based approach with end-To-end automatic feature extraction for protein classification. Our results show that SecBert performs well, achieving an average area under the ROC curve of 0.94-0.95 on each fluid test dataset. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Human Body Fluids; Secreted Protein; Deep Learning; Molecular Biology; Proteins; Statistical Tests; Automatic Feature Extraction; Degrees Of Complexity; End To End; Human Body Fluids; Learning Frameworks; Physiological Disorders; Protein Prediction; Proteomic Techniques; Secreted Protein; Body Fluids,Deep learning; Molecular biology; Proteins; Statistical tests; Automatic feature extraction; Degrees of complexity; End to end; Human body fluids; Learning frameworks; Physiological disorders; Protein prediction; Proteomic techniques; Secreted protein; Body fluids,,,,"Anderson, N.

More over 60% of the world’s population relies mostly on agricultural sources for food, according to linked statistics. Plant infections, however, are a catastrophic issue that seriously hampers agriculture productivity. Plant diseases cause a loss of agriculture productivity of about 25% per year. Potato crops have many benefits for human life. One of the most valuable benefits of potatoes for humans is their carbohydrate content; carbohydrates are the leading food for humans. The development of potato crop agriculture is significant for the sustainability of human life. There are several obstacles to developing potato farming, including a disease that attacks potato leaves. Infestans only the diseases early Blight (Alternia Solani) and late Blight (Phytophthora infestans de Bary) are among the most harmful to potato crops. However, the percentage of crops that fail to grow grows due to the erroneous and tardy identification of plant diseases. Using a diagnostic and detection system based on the Hybrid CNN (Convolutional neural network) with SVM (Support vector machine) presently deep learning (DL) technology, we offer an efficient and accurate way to identify early plant illnesses to reduce the plant output losses. Potato leaf disease detection issues can be resolved with the use of informatics technology and digital image processing. From the input photos of the supported training dataset, we utilised CNN to extract best feature of the illness characteristics, and then we used SVM to those features to do classification. 1900 photos of potato leaves were used to train the deep learning model, and about 950 images were utilised for testing.

The agriculture sector accounts for a significant portion of the country's overall economy. Plant diseases are particularly important because they can have a negative impact on the quality and quantity of crops. Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms can cause plant diseases. The majority of farmers are completely unaware of such diseases. In India, the tomato crop is a common staple due to its high commercial value and strong production potential. In tomatoes, the three most potent antioxidants are vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta-carotene. The main focus of the proposed article is to create a more accurate and time-efficient automatic method for detecting tomato plant leaf diseases. This work aims to create a system that captures images with a Raspberry Pi camera and classifies them using Convolutional Neural Network. In neural network models, automatic feature extraction is utilized to help classify input photos into appropriate illness categories. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Prediction; Training; Convolution; Crops; Diseases; Fruits; Viruses; Agriculture Sectors; Convolutional Neural Network; E Vitamin; Health Management; Plant Disease; Plant Healths; Potent Antioxidants; Tomato Crops; Tomato Plants; Vitamin-e; Convolutional Neural Networks,Convolution; Crops; Diseases; Fruits; Viruses; Agriculture sectors; Convolutional neural network; E vitamin; Health management; Plant disease; Plant healths; Potent antioxidants; Tomato crops; Tomato plants; Vitamin-E; Convolutional neural networks,,,,"Khirade, Sachin D., Plant disease detection using image processing, pp. 768-771, (2015); Tm, Prajwala, Tomato Leaf Disease Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks, (2018); Ongsulee, Pariwat, Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, International Conference on ICT and Knowledge Engineering, pp. 1-6, (2018); Sabrol, Hiteshwari, Tomato plant disease classification in digital images using classification tree, pp. 1242-1246, (2016); Mokhtar, Usama, SVM-Based detection of tomato leaves diseases, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 323, pp. 641-652, (2015); Jhuria, Monika, Image processing for smart farming: Detection of disease and fruit grading, pp. 521-526, (2013); Disease Detection on the Leaves of the Tomato Plants by Using Deep Learning, (2017); Qassim, Hussam, Compressed residual-VGG16 CNN model for big data places image recognition, 2018-January, pp. 169-175, (2018); undefined",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"3rd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, Embedded and Secure Systems, ACCESS 2023",,Ernakulam,191492,,9798350346169,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168696191

After rice and maize, cassava ranks third among common food sources of carbohydrates. Over half a billion people in the developing world rely on cassava as a staple crop for daily nutrition. It is one of the crops that can grow on poor soils and is one of the most drought-tolerant. Cassava is produced extensively in Nigeria, and cassava starch is exported most widely from Thailand. Even though the deep convolution neural network technique had respectable results for classifying cassava photos. The proposed work identifies Cassava leaf disease using a CNN-based pre-trained deep learning algorithm.

Due to various plant diseases found in Cassava, security threat is posed in developing countries. To stop spoiling the whole plant, a lot of effort has been made by researchers to identify early leaf disease as agricultural farming is closely associated with every country’s economy. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) models have achieved a lot of success with big data, available resources and improvement in learning algorithms. However, there are invalid instances in big data like ambiguous or mislabelled or irrelevant. Though the performance of ML model is not degraded if such instances are small as the effect of the average gradient is small during the training. But the performance of system is degraded if quantity of invalid instances is large. The existing work for leaf disease detection is performed using Model Centric approach, where hyperparameter tuning is performed to enhance the performance of the system. Recently, focus in changed from Model Centric to Data Centric approach, where model is fixed but quality of dataset is enhanced by considering the consistency of labels, systematic sampling of training data and selection of appropriate batches. This is an invaluable step towards improvement of any system. In this work, noise label detection and correction are performed on Cassava Leaf Disease Classification dataset using confidence learning. The generated quality data is given to the model, and performance comparison is made between model centric and data centric approaches, which concludes that the performance of data centric is improved by 6.33%. The conclusion of this work is not to downgrade the significance of model centric, but to showcase the neglected potential of enhancing the performance of such systems using data centric approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Data Cleaning; Data Preparation; Feature Engineering; Supervised Learning; Big Data; Classification (of Information); Farms; Learning Algorithms; Plants (botany); Supervised Learning; Data Cleaning; Data Preparation; Data-centric Approaches; Disease Classification; Feature Engineerings; Leaf Disease; Machine Learning Models; Performance; Plant Disease; Security Threats; Developing Countries,Big data; Classification (of information); Farms; Learning algorithms; Plants (botany); Supervised learning; Data cleaning; Data preparation; Data-centric approaches; Disease classification; Feature engineerings; Leaf disease; Machine learning models; Performance; Plant disease; Security threats; Developing countries,,,,"International Conference on Learning Representations, (2019); Ayu, H.

The phenotype, quality, and yield of crops are all influenced by the nitrogen level in precision agriculture. In the future, it won’t be possible to achieve without the application of nitrogen fertilizer. A useful and cutting edge technique for diagnosing the nitrogen nutrition of crops is needed for an effective and appropriate nitrogen fertilizer management system. Plant diseases that have a substantial impact on agricultural output are brought on by nutrient deficiency. Rice producers can reduce output loss significantly by taking essential measures with the help of early disease identification. Deep learning, an effective machine learning method, has recently demonstrated considerable potential in the task of classifying images.

Over the past few years, there has been a significant growth in the application of machine learning and computer vision techniques, in early detection and classification of plant disorders. This study, proposes a deep learning-based approach for detecting nutritional deficiencies in guava leaf images. A dataset of guava leaf images captured using mobile devices, containing various nutritional deficiencies including magnesium and phosphorous, was acquired for training the model. A pre-trained deep CNN model is employed to extract convolved features and detect the affected regions, categorizing them as nutritional deficient or non-nutritional deficient Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 87% in detecting nutritional deficiencies in guava leaf images. These outcomes demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a reliable and accurate method for early detection of nutritional deficiencies in guava leaves.

Xanthomonas fragariae is the causative agent of angular leaf spot in strawberries, where it poses a significant threat to the strawberry industry. Both pathogens rely on the type III secretion system and the translocation of effector proteins into the plant cells for their pathogenicity. Effectidor is a freely available web server we have previously developed for the prediction of type III effectors in bacterial genomes. Following a complete genome sequencing and assembly of an Israeli isolate of Xanthomonas hortorum pv. pelargonii - strain 305, we used Effectidor to predict effector encoding genes both in this newly sequenced genome, and in X. fragariae strain Fap21, and validated its predictions experimentally. Four and two genes in X. hortorum and X. fragariae, respectively, contained an active translocation signal that allowed the translocation of the reporter AvrBs2 that induced the hypersensitive response in pepper leaves, and are thus considered validated novel effectors.

Agriculture relies heavily on the soil. Different kinds of dirt can be found in various locations. Each type of soil can have unique characteristics to develop crops. To cultivate crops in diverse soil types, we need to know which kind of soil is best. Accurate soil moisture and temperature forecast are beneficial to agriculture planting factors. According to the review articles, machine learning approaches, deep learning prediction models, and computer vision are helpful in this instance. The external temperature and humidity and soil moisture and temperature are used to train and test to anticipate soil moisture and temperature. A deep learning model was developed based on the extended short-term memory network (LSTM). Machine learning models such as k-nearest neighbor, SVM, and RF methods are utilized for soil classification. Several contributions of computer vision models in fields like planting, harvesting, enhanced weather analysis, weeding, and plant health detection and monitoring have been shown in the application of computer vision in soil categorization.

Early identification and disease diagnosis of fruit crops are essential for the food industry to increase production. The development of the healthy fruit sector is highly dependent on plant diseases. Guava fruit is a good source of fiber, calcium, pectins, and vitamin C. Guava disease has become a major issue for guava production, which has a negative impact on farmers' socioeconomic growth. Infections that harm guava plants and fruits pose the greatest obstacles, although they can be avoided by early identification. Deep learning has recently been widely used to automatically identify a variety of diseases that cannot be seen with the human eye. In this study, convolution neural models are suggested to use leaf images to detect guava disease. The presented models can be used to categorize the main guava leaf diseases, including Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. The kaggle dataset is used to gather images of guava with the disease Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. In our work, CNN models like DenseNet121, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, and Xception are used to categorize the diseases that affect guava leaves. The experimental findings indicate that, with an accuracy of 96.12%, the DenseNet169 model outperformed other models.

Soil testing is an effective tool for evaluating soil nutrient levels and calculating the appropriate quantitative of soil nutrients based on fertility and crop requirements. Because traditional soil nutrient testing models are impractical for real-time applications, efficient soil nutrient and potential hydrogen (pH) prediction models are required to improve overall crop productivity. Soil testing is an effective method to evaluate the presence of nutrient status of soil and assists in determining appropriate nutrient quantity. Methods: Various machine learning (ML) models proposed, predict the soil nutrients, soil type, and soil moisture. To assess the significant soil nutrient content, this study develops an enhanced reptile search optimization with convolutional autoencoder (ERSOCAE-SNC) model for classifying and predicting the fertility indices. The model majorly focuses on the soil test reports. For classification, CAE model is applied which accurately determines the nutrient levels such as phosphorus (P), available potassium (K), organic carbon (OC), boron (B) and soil pH level. Since the trial-and-error method for hyperparameter tuning of CAE model is a tedious and erroneous process, the ERSO algorithm has been utilized which in turn enhances the classification performance. Besides, the ERSO algorithm is derived by incorporating the chaotic concepts into the RSO algorithm. Results: Finally, the influence of the ERSOCAE-SNC model is examined using a series of simulations. The ERSOCAE-SNC model reported best results over other approaches and produces an accuracy of 98.99% for soil nutrients and 99.12% for soil pH. The model developed for the ML decision systems will help the Tamil Nadu government to manage the problems in soil nutrient deficiency and improve the soil health and environmental quality. Also reduces the input expenditures of fertilizers and saves time of soil experts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Autoencoder; Hyperparameter Tuning; Machine Learning; Reptile Search Optimization; Soil Nutrients; Boron; Chlorophyll A; Hydrogen; Manganese; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Phosphorus Pentoxide; Potassium; Boron; Chlorophyll A; Fertilizer; Hydrogen; Manganese; Nitrogen; Organic Carbon; Phosphorus; Phosphorus Pentoxide; Potassium; Trace Element; Algorithm; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Autoencoder; Crop; Decision Tree; Electric Conductivity; Environmental Factor; Exploratory Behavior; Flame Photometry; Harvest; Learning Algorithm; Machine Learning; Macronutrient; Moisture; Nonhuman; Nutrient; Nutrient Content; Ph; Plant Stress; Principal Component Analysis; Process Optimization; Productivity; Random Forest; Reptile; Simulation; Soil Acidity; Soil Analysis; Soil Fertility; Soil Health; Soil Moisture; Support Vector Machine,boron; chlorophyll a; fertilizer; hydrogen; manganese; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; phosphorus pentoxide; potassium; trace element; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; autoencoder; crop; decision tree; electric conductivity; environmental factor; exploratory behavior; flame photometry; harvest; learning algorithm; machine learning; macronutrient; moisture; nonhuman; nutrient; nutrient content; pH; plant stress; principal component analysis; process optimization; productivity; random forest; reptile; simulation; soil acidity; soil analysis; soil fertility; soil health; soil moisture; support vector machine,,"boron, 7440-42-8; chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; phosphorus pentoxide, 1314-56-3; potassium, 7440-09-7",,"Abualigah, Laith Mohammad Qasim, Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA): A nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimizer, Expert Systems with Applications, 191, (2022); International Journal of Engineering Applied Sciences and Technology, (2019); Trontelj Ml, Janez, Machine learning strategy for soil nutrients prediction using spectroscopic method, Sensors, 21, 12, (2021); Garg, Raghu, Extracting knowledge from big data for sustainability: A comparison of machine learning techniques, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 23, (2019); Int Res J Eng Technol Irjet, (2018); Han, Xiaoxia, An Improved Crow Search Algorithm Based on Spiral Search Mechanism for Solving Numerical and Engineering Optimization Problems, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 92363-92382, (2020); John, Kingsley, Using machine learning algorithms to estimate soil organic carbon variability with environmental variables and soil nutrient indicators in an alluvial soil, Land, 9, 12, pp. 1-20, (2020); Kalaji, Hazem M., Chlorophyll fluorescence as a tool for nutrient status identification in rapeseed plants, Photosynthesis Research, 136, 3, pp. 329-343, (2018); Soft Computing for Intelligent Systems, (2021); Keerthan Kumar, T.

They are the primary producers of our food, but they still live in poverty. There are many reasons for this, but one of these is damage caused to their crops by different diseases, either caused by some bacteria, viruses, or some mineral deficiency diseases. They have a deleterious impact on crops, lowering both quality and quantity. In this paper, we have used image processing and k-nearest neighbours (KNN)-based algorithm to detect plant disease with an implementation on the Raspberry Pi. At first, the leaf image is segmented, and later features such as area, entropy, and aspect ratio are extracted. These features are fed to the KNN classifier to get the desired result. Using this technology, it will have a significant impact on farming. The cost of fertilizers and excessive or wrong use of pesticides can be reduced, and hence, it can lead to an increase in productivity.

Food labels provide consumers with information regarding the nutritional content of food items and have been identified as a potential tool for improving diets. However, due to governmental regulations and the physical limitations of the labels, food labels often lack comprehensive information about the vitamins and minerals present in foods. As a result, information about most of the micronutrients is absent from existing food labels. Objective: This paper aims to examine the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to predict unreported micronutrients such as vitamin A (retinol), vitamin C, vitamin B1 (thiamin), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), vitamin K, and minerals such as magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, selenium, manganese, and copper from nutrition information provided on existing food labels. If unreported micronutrients can be predicted with acceptable accuracies from existing food labels using machine learning predictive models, such models can be integrated into mobile apps to provide consumers with additional micronutrient information about foods and help them make more informed diet decisions. Methods: Data from the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) data set, representing a total of 5624 foods, were used to train a diverse set of machine learning classification and regression algorithms to predict unreported vitamins and minerals from existing food label data. For each model, hyperparameters were adjusted, and the models were evaluated using repeated cross-validation to ensure that the reported results were not subject to overfitting. Results: According to the results, while predicting the exact quantity of vitamins and minerals is shown to be challenging, with regression R2 varying in a wide range from 0.28 (for magnesium) to 0.92 (for manganese), the classification models can accurately predict the category (“low,” “medium,” or “high”) level of all minerals and vitamins with accuracies exceeding 0.80. The highest classification accuracies for specific micronutrients are achieved for vitamin B12 (0.94) and phosphorus (0.94), while the lowest are for vitamin E (0.81) and selenium (0.83). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting unreported micronutrients from existing food labels using machine learning algorithms. The results show that the approach has the potential to significantly improve consumer knowledge about the micronutrient content of the foods they consume. Integrating these predictive models into mobile apps can enhance their accessibility and engagement with consumers. The implications of this research for public health are noteworthy, underscoring the potential of technology to augment consumers’ understanding of the micronutrient content of their diets while also facilitating the tracking of food intake and providing personalized recommendations based on the micronutrient content and individual preferences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Algorithm; Diet; Food; Food Label; Health App; Machine Learning; Mhealth; Micronutrient; Micronutrient Deficiencies; Mobile App; Mobile Health; Nutrient; Nutrition; Nutrition Mobile Applications; Predict; Predictive Model; Alpha Tocopherol; Ascorbic Acid; Calcium; Copper; Cyanocobalamin; Iron; Magnesium; Manganese; Nicotinamide; Nicotinic Acid; Phosphorus; Potassium; Protein; Pyridoxine; Retinol; Riboflavin; Selenium; Sodium; Thiamine; Vitamin B Group; Vitamin K Group; Zinc; Magnesium; Manganese; Micronutrients; Phosphorus; Selenium; Thiamine; Trace Elements; Vitamin A; Vitamin B 12; Vitamins; Alpha Tocopherol; Ascorbic Acid; Calcium; Carbohydrate; Copper; Cyanocobalamin; Fat; Iron; Magnesium; Manganese; Mineral; Nicotinamide; Nicotinic Acid; Phosphorus; Potassium; Protein; Pyridoxine; Retinol; Riboflavin; Selenium; Sodium; Sugar; Thiamine; Trace Element; Vitamin; Vitamin B Group; Vitamin D; Vitamin K Group; Zinc; Algorithm; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Brain; Chronic Disease; Classification; Consumer; Cross Validation; Decision Tree; Feasibility Study; Food Intake; Food Packaging; Human; K Nearest Neighbor; Logistic Regression Analysis; Machine Learning; Micronutrient Intake; Motivation; Nutrient; Nutritional Deficiency; Prediction; Predictive Model; Random Forest; Regression Model; Support Vector Machine; Validation Process; Vitamin Blood Level; Diet; Diet; Humans; Magnesium; Manganese; Micronutrients; Phosphorus; Selenium; Thiamine; Trace Elements; Vitamin A; Vitamin B 12; Vitamins,alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; calcium; carbohydrate; copper; cyanocobalamin; fat; iron; magnesium; manganese; mineral; nicotinamide; nicotinic acid; phosphorus; potassium; protein; pyridoxine; retinol; riboflavin; selenium; sodium; sugar; thiamine; trace element; vitamin; vitamin B group; vitamin D; vitamin K group; zinc; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; brain; chronic disease; classification; consumer; cross validation; decision tree; feasibility study; food intake; food packaging; human; k nearest neighbor; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; micronutrient intake; motivation; nutrient; nutritional deficiency; prediction; predictive model; random forest; regression model; support vector machine; validation process; vitamin blood level; diet; Diet; Humans; Magnesium; Manganese; Micronutrients; Phosphorus; Selenium; Thiamine; Trace Elements; Vitamin A; Vitamin B 12; Vitamins,,"alpha tocopherol, 1406-18-4, 1406-70-8, 52225-20-4, 58-95-7, 59-02-9; ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; cyanocobalamin, 53570-76-6, 68-19-9, 8064-09-3; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; magnesium, 7439-95-4; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; nicotinamide, 11032-50-1, 98-92-0; nicotinic acid, 54-86-4, 59-67-6; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; protein, 67254-75-5; pyridoxine, 12001-77-3, 58-56-0, 65-23-6, 8059-24-3; retinol, 68-26-8, 82445-97-4; riboflavin, 83-88-5; selenium, 7782-49-2; sodium, 7440-23-5; thiamine, 59-43-8, 67-03-8; vitamin B group, 12001-76-2; vitamin K group, 12001-79-5; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Magnesium; Manganese; Micronutrients; Phosphorus; Selenium; Thiamine; Trace Elements; Vitamin A; Vitamin B 12; Vitamins",,"World Health Report, (2000); Black, Robert E., Maternal and child undernutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences, The Lancet, 371, 9608, pp. 243-260, (2008); Montgomery, Stephanie C., Micronutrient needs of the elderly, Nutrition in Clinical Practice, 29, 4, pp. 435-444, (2014); Miller, Lisa M.Soederberg, Developing nutrition label reading skills:a web-based practice approach, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 19, 1, (2017); Volkova, Ekaterina, Smart"" RCTs: Development of a smartphone app for fully automated nutrition-labeling intervention trials, JMIR mHealth and uHealth, 4, 1, (2016); Mönninghoff, Annette, The Effect of a Future-Self Avatar Mobile Health Intervention (FutureMe) on Physical Activity and Food Purchases: Randomized Controlled Trial, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 24, 7, (2022); Giró-Candanedo, Mar, Use and Understanding of Nutrition Labels: Impact of Diet Attachment, Foods, 11, 13, (2022); Anastasiou, Kim, The relationship between food label use and dietary intake in adults: A systematic review, Appetite, 138, pp. 280-291, (2019); Miller, Lisa M.Soederberg, The effects of nutrition knowledge on food label use.

Infected plants have an impact on the agricultural production and economic resources of a country. Early detection of plant diseases minimizes the risk of crop loss by allowing farmers to adopt curative and preventative actions to avoid further damage. Citrus is a large plant that is primarily grown in tropical areas of the world because of its high vitamin C and other key nutrient content. Citrus plant diseases play a vital role in causing a great financial loss to the farmers and affect the economy of the country. The tomato ranks among the most economically important vegetable crops, with a global production rate of around 200 million tonnes. But due to diseases occurring in the tomato plants, the farmers are facing a great loss. To prevent these losses and provide an immediate cure, we create a model to detect plant diseases. To get a better performance model, the data augmentation process is used, and we got 18,392 images. In our model, we used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the citrus and tomato leaf diseases. The diseases are Mancha Graxa, Citrus Canker, Tomato Early Blight, Tomato Septoria Leafspot, Tomato Spider Mite Two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), Tomato mosaic virus (Tobamovirus), Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (Begomovirus), Tomato Target Spot (Corynespora cassiicola). Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is stacked by multiple convolutions and pooling layers to detect plant leaf diseases. We train a model with augmented images. After the model gets trained, it is thoroughly tested to ensure that the results are accurate. Thereby we were able to achieve high validation accuracy with a rate of (97.02%) for this dataset used. As the results showed, applying the deep CNN model to identify diseases could greatly impact the accurate identification of diseases, and could even prove useful in detecting diseases in real-time agricultural systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Citrus Disease; Convolutional Neural Network (cnn); Deep Learning; Tomato Diseases; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Damage Detection; Deep Learning; Drought; Fruits; Multilayer Neural Networks; Real Time Systems; Tropics; Viruses; Agricultural Productions; Citrus Disease; Convolutional Neural Network; Economic Resources; Leaf Disease; Plant Disease; Production Resources; Tomato Disease; Losses,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Damage detection; Deep learning; Drought; Fruits; Multilayer neural networks; Real time systems; Tropics; Viruses; Agricultural productions; Citrus disease; Convolutional neural network; Economic resources; Leaf disease; Plant disease; Production resources; Tomato disease; Losses,,,,"International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering, (2020); A Novel Citrus Disease Detection and Classification Using Deep Learning Based Inception Resnet V2 Model; Zeng, Qingmao, GANS-based data augmentation for citrus disease severity detection using deep learning, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 172882-172891, (2020); Huang, Sijiang, Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for the recognition of plant disease, pp. 1951-1957, (2019); Kukreja, Vinay, A Deep Neural Network based disease detection scheme for Citrus fruits, pp. 97-101, (2020); Mohanty, Sharada Prasanna, Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection, Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, September, (2016); Song, Chauchung, Automatic Detection and Image Recognition of Precision Agriculture for Citrus Diseases, pp. 187-190, (2020); Jasim, Marwan Adnan, Plant Leaf Diseases Detection and Classification Using Image Processing and Deep Learning Techniques, pp. 259-265, (2020); International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security Ijcsis, (2019); Alruwaili, Madallah, An enhanced plant disease classifier model based on deep learning techniques, International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology, 9, 1, pp. 7159-7164, (2019)","Kannan, R.J.; Thampi, S.M.; Wang, S.",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,"4th International Conference on Recent Trends in Advanced Computing - Computer Vision and Machine Intelligence Paradigms for Sustainable Development Goals, ICRTAC-CVMIP 2021",,Chennai,289339,18761119; 18761100,9789819680023; 9789819658473; 9789819600571; 9789819644292; 9789819637577; 9783319030135; 9783642363283; 9789819648115; 9783642384653; 9789819920914,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147854226

There is also an urgent need to increase the number of alternative techniques for detecting plant diseases, which is now lacking. The agriculture and agricultural support sectors in India provide employment for the great majority of the country’s people. In India, the agricultural production of the country is directly connected to the country’s economic growth rate. In order to sustain healthy plant development, a variety of processes must be followed, including consideration of environmental factors and water supply management for the optimal production of crops. It is inefficient and uncertain in its outcomes to use the traditional method of watering a lawn. The devastation of more than 18% of the world’s agricultural produce is caused by disease attacks on an annual basis. Because it is difficult to execute these activities manually, identifying plant diseases is essential to decreasing losses in the agricultural product business. In addition to diagnosing a wide range of plant ailments, our method also includes the identification of infections as a prophylactic step. Below is a detailed description of a farm-based module that includes numerous cloud data centers and data conversion devices for accurately monitoring and managing farm information and environmental elements. This procedure involves imaging the plant’s visually obvious signs in order to identify disease. It is recommended that the therapy be used in conjunction with an application to minimize any harm. Increased productivity as a result of the suggested approach would help both the agricultural and irrigation sectors. The plant area module is fitted with a mobile camera that captures images of all of the plants in the area, and all of the plants’ information is saved in a database, which is accessible from any computer with Internet access. It is planned to record information on the plant’s name, the type of illness that has been afflicted, and an image of the plant. In a wide range of applications, bots are used to collect images of various plants as well as to prevent disease transmission. To ensure that all information given is retained on the Internet, data is collected and stored in cloud storage as it becomes essential to regulate the condition. According to our findings from our research on wide images of healthy and ill fruit and plant leaves, real-time diagnosis of plant leaf diseases may be done with 98.78% accuracy in a laboratory environment. We utilized 40,000 photographs and then analyzed 10,000 photos to construct a DCDM deep learning model, which was then used to train additional models on the data set. Using a cloud-based image diagnostic and classification service, consumers may receive information about their condition in less than a second on average, with the process requiring only 0.349 s on average. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Product Sector; Cloud Data Center; Cloud Storage; Deeplens Classification And Detection Model (dcdm); Mobile Camera; Plant Diseases; Agricultural Technology; Cameras; Cloud Storage; Data Handling; Diagnosis; Economics; Fruits; Plants (botany); Water Management; Agricultural Product Sector; Classification Models; Cloud Data Centers; Cloud Storages; Cloud-based; Condition; Deeplens Classification And Detection Model; Detection Models; Mobile Camera; Plant Disease; Water Supply; Unclassified Drug; Accuracy Assessment; Agricultural Application; Crop Production; Detection Method; Disease Control; Disease Incidence; Disease Transmission; Environmental Monitoring; Identification Method; Image Analysis; Image Classification; Information And Communication Technology; Internet; Irrigation System; Real Time; Accuracy; Agricultural Worker; Agriculture; Algorithm; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Ascending Aorta; Cloud Computing; Consumer; Crop; Deep Learning; Deeplens Classification And Detection Model; Diagnostic Accuracy; Economic Development; Employment; Environmental Factor; Food Safety; Fruit; Growth Rate; Image Processing; Image Quality; Image Segmentation; India; Internet Access; Kernel Method; Learning Algorithm; Machine Learning; Mathematical Analysis; Nonhuman; Photography; Plant Development; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Productivity; Protein Secondary Structure; Responsibility; Robotics; Support Vector Machine; Water Supply; Human; Mobile Application; Prevention And Control; Cloud Computing; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Mobile Applications; Plant Diseases,Agricultural technology; Cameras; Cloud storage; Data handling; Diagnosis; Economics; Fruits; Plants (botany); Water management; Agricultural product sector; Classification models; Cloud data centers; Cloud storages; Cloud-based; Condition; Deeplens classification and detection model; Detection models; Mobile camera; Plant disease; Water supply; unclassified drug; accuracy assessment; agricultural application; crop production; detection method; disease control; disease incidence; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; identification method; image analysis; image classification; information and communication technology; Internet; irrigation system; real time; accuracy; agricultural worker; agriculture; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; ascending aorta; cloud computing; consumer; crop; deep learning; deeplens classification and detection model; diagnostic accuracy; economic development; employment; environmental factor; food safety; fruit; growth rate; image processing; image quality; image segmentation; India; internet access; kernel method; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; photography; plant development; plant disease; plant leaf; productivity; protein secondary structure; responsibility; robotics; support vector machine; water supply; human; mobile application; prevention and control; Cloud Computing; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Mobile Applications; Plant Diseases,,,,"Akram, Tallha, Towards real-time crops surveillance for disease classification: exploiting parallelism in computer vision, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 59, pp. 15-26, (2017); DeChant, Chad, Automated identification of northern leaf blight-infected maize plants from field imagery using deep learning, Phytopathology, 107, 11, pp. 1426-1432, (2017); International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering, (2020); Chopda, Jayraj, Cotton Crop Disease Detection using Decision Tree Classifier, (2018); Coulibaly, Solemane, Deep neural networks with transfer learning in millet crop images, Computers in Industry, 108, pp. 115-120, (2019); Plant Diseases Recognition from Digital Images Using Multichannel Convolutional Neural Networks, (2019); de Luna, Robert G., Automated Image Capturing System for Deep Learning-based Tomato Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Recognition, IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON, 2018-October, pp. 1414-1419, (2018); Sangwan, Dhiraj, An effective analysis of deep learning based approaches for audio based feature extraction and its visualization, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 78, 17, pp. 23949-23972, (2019); Ferentinos, Konstantinos P., Deep learning models for plant disease detection and diagnosis, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 145, pp. 311-318, (2018); Math Comput Appl, (2017)",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,15732959; 01676369,,EMASD,36302915,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140647930

The UN also recognized this need through Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 2 and SDG 12) to end hunger and foster sustainable agriculture by enhancing the production and consumption of fruits and vegetables. Previous studies only stressed the various issues in horticulture with regard to industries, but they did not emphasize the centrality of Industry 4.0 technologies for confronting the diverse issues in horticulture, from production to marketing in the context of sustainability. The current study addresses the significance and application of Industry 4.0 technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data for horticulture in enhancing traditional practices for disease detection, irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification, marketing, and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest. On the basis of analysis, the article identifies challenges and suggests a few vital recommendations for future work. In horticulture settings, robotics, drones with vision technology and AI for the detection of pests, weeds, plant diseases, and malnutrition, and edge-computing portable devices that can be developed with IoT and AI for predicting and estimating crop diseases are vital recommendations suggested in the study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ar; Bigdata; Blockchain; Horticulture; Industry 4.0; Iot; Micronutrient; Real-time Prediction; Sdgs,,,,"The APC was funded by Tshwane University of Technology, South Africa.","undefined; undefined; undefined; Proceedings of the International Symposia on Tropical and Temperate Horticulture Istth2016 1205; International Conference on Geo Informatics in Resource Management and Sustainable Ecosystem, (2016); Cappelli, Irene, Autonomous IoT Monitoring Matching Spectral Artificial Light Manipulation for Horticulture, Sensors, 22, 11, (2022); Lamm, Kevan W., Identifying critical issues in the horticulture industry: A delphi analysis during the covid-19 pandemic, Horticulturae, 7, 11, (2021); J Pharm Phytochem, (2021); Yang, Biyun, Applications of deep-learning approaches in horticultural research: a review, Horticulture Research, 8, 1, (2021); Ariesen-Verschuur, Natasja, Digital Twins in greenhouse horticulture: A review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 199, (2022)",,MDPI,,,,,,20763417,,,,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144829455

Facing incidence of different physiological disorders such as callusing, shoot tip necrosis (STN) and vitrification (Vit) in walnut proliferation, it is necessary to develop prediction models for identifying the impact of different factors involving in this process. In the present study, three machine learning (ML) approaches including multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and gene expression programming (GEP) were implemented and compared to multiple linear regression (MLR) to develop models for prediction of in vitro proliferation of Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.). The accuracy of developed models was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). With the aim of optimizing the selected prediction models, multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique was applied. Results: Our results indicated that all three ML techniques had higher accuracy of prediction than MLR, for example, calculated R2 of MLPNN, KNN and GEP vs. MLR was 0.695, 0.672 and 0.802 vs. 0.412 in Chandler and 0.358, 0.377 and 0.428 vs. 0.178 in Rayen, respectively. The GEP models were further selected to be optimized using PSO. The comparison of modeling procedures provides a new insight into in vitro culture medium composition prediction models. Based on the results, hybrid GEP-PSO technique displays good performance for modeling walnut tissue culture media, while MLPNN and KNN have also shown strong estimation capability. Conclusion: Here, besides MLPNN and GEP, KNN also is introduced, for the first time, as a simple technique with high accuracy to be used for developing prediction models in optimizing plant tissue culture media composition studies. Therefore, selection of the modeling technique to study depends on the researcher’s desire regarding the simplicity of the procedure, obtaining clear results as entire formula and/or less time to analyze. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Neural Network; Gene Expression Programming; K-nearest Neighbors; Prediction Model; Walnut In Vitro Propagation,,,,"We also would like to thank University of Jiroft, University of Tehran, Tarbiat Modares University (TMU), Iran National Science Foundation (INSF), Iran’s National Elite Foundation (INEF) and Center of Excellence for Walnut Improvement and Technology of Iran, for their supports.","Fruit Breeding, (2012); Skender, Azra, Phenotypic variability of autochthonous walnut (Juglansregia L) genotypes in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry, 44, 5, pp. 517-525, (2020); Hortscience, (1984); Cell and Tissue Culture in Forestry, (1987); Ann Sci for, (1989); Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry, (1997); IV International Walnut Symposium, (1999); V International Walnut Symposium 705, (2004); I International Symposium on Biotechnology of Fruit Species Biotechfruit2008 839 200; In Vitro Propagation of Several Walnut Cultivars, (2012)",,BioMed Central Ltd,,,,,,17464811,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128202273

It is even more difficult at a public health scale seeking to identify regions at higher risk of MND. To provide data more widely and frequently, we propose an accurate, scalable, low-cost, and interpretable regional-level MND prediction system. Specifically, our work is the first to use satellite data, such as forest cover, weather, and presence of water, to predict deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin A, directly from their biomarkers. We use real-world, ground truth biomarker data collected from four different regions across Madagascar for training, and demonstrate that satellite data are viable for predicting regional-level MND, surprisingly exceeding the performance of baseline predictions based only on survey responses. Our method could be broadly applied to other countries where satellite data are available, and potentially create high societal impact if these predictions are used by policy makers, public health officials, or healthcare providers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Biomarkers; Health Risks; Nutrients; Public Health; Satellites; Trace Elements; Forest Cover; Health Consequences; Low-costs; Prediction Systems; Presence Of Water; Real-world; Regional Levels; Satellite Data; Vitamin A; Vitamin B12; Forecasting,Artificial intelligence; Biomarkers; Health risks; Nutrients; Public health; Satellites; Trace elements; Forest cover; Health consequences; Low-costs; Prediction systems; Presence of water; Real-world; Regional levels; Satellite data; Vitamin A; Vitamin B12; Forecasting,,,"We are grateful for the support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (Grant AID-FFP-A-14-00,008) implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in consortium with four local implementing partners in Madagascar; the Ren Che Foundation; the ARO under Grant Number: W911NF-18-1-0208; and the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS).

Predicting ubiquitination is an important technical method for plant protection. Traditional ubiquitination site determination methods are costly and time-consuming, while computational-based prediction methods can accurately and efficiently predict ubiquitination sites. At present, capsule networks and deep learning are used alone for prediction, and the effect is not obvious. The capsule network reflects the spatial position relationship of the internal features of the neural network, but it cannot identify long-distance dependencies or focus on amino acids in protein sequences or their degree of importance. In this study, we investigated the use of convolutional neural networks and capsule networks in deep learning to design a novel model “Caps-Ubi,” first using the one-hot and amino acid continuous type hybrid encoding method to characterize ubiquitination sites. The sequence patterns, the dependencies between the encoded protein sequences and the important amino acids in the captured sequences, were then focused on the importance of amino acids in the sequences through the proposed Caps-Ubi model and used for multispecies ubiquitination site prediction.

Mango fruit is one of the most popular and desirable fruits worldwide due to its taste and richness in vitamins. However, plant diseases also affect these plants’ production and quality. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based metaheuristic approach for disease diagnosis and detection. The proposed approach involves preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and disease classification. First, the image of mango leaves is enhanced using histogram equalization and contrast enhancement. Then, a geometric mean-based neutrosophic with a fuzzy c-means method is used for segmentation. Next, the essential features are retrieved from the segmented images, including the Upgraded Local Binary Pattern (ULBP), color, and pixel features. Finally, these features are given into the disease detection phase, which is modeled using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (deep learning model). Furthermore, to enhance the classification accuracy of CNN, the weights are fine-tuned using a new hybrid optimization model referred to as Cat Swarm Updated Black Widow Model (CSUBW). The new hybrid optimization model is developed by hybridizing the standard Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSO) and Black Widow Optimization Algorithm (BWO). Finally, a performance evaluation is undergone to validate the efficiency of the projected model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Black Widow Algorithm; Botanical Leaf Disease; Cat Swarm Optimization; Cnn,,,,Acknowledgments: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Government Order FENU-2020-0022).,"Chouhan, Siddharth Singh, Web Facilitated Anthracnose Disease Segmentation from the Leaf of Mango Tree Using Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network, Wireless Personal Communications, 113, 2, pp. 1279-1296, (2020); Mia, Md Rasel, Mango leaf disease recognition using neural network and support vector machine, Iran Journal of Computer Science, 3, 3, pp. 185-193, (2020); Venkatesh, Transfer Learning based Convolutional Neural Network Model for Classification of Mango Leaves Infected by Anthracnose, (2020); Adv Nat Appl Sci, (2017); Singh, Uday Pratap, Multilayer Convolution Neural Network for the Classification of Mango Leaves Infected by Anthracnose Disease, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 43721-43729, (2019); Proceedings of the International Conference on Computing Advancements, (2020); Proceeding to the 2019 International Conference on Vedio Signal and Image Processing, (2019); Proceedings of the 2019 8th International Conference on Computing and Pattern Recognition, (2020); Trongtorkid, Chutinan, Expert system for diagnosis mango diseases using leaf symptoms analysis, pp. 59-64, (2018); Trang, Kien, Mango Diseases Identification by a Deep Residual Network with Contrast Enhancement and Transfer Learning, pp. 138-142, (2019)",,MDPI,,,,,,2073431X,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130954217

This method can solve the problems of noise, background interference, and low detection accuracy of maize leaf disease images. To begin, a processing layer called Wavelet threshold guided bilateral filtering (WT-GBF) based on the WG-MARNet model is employed to reduce image noise and perform high and low-frequency decomposition of the input image using WT-GBF. This increases the input image’s resistance to environmental interference and feature extraction capability. Secondly, for the multiscale feature fusion technique, an average down-sampling and tiling method is employed to increase feature representation and limit the risk of overfitting. Then, on high and low-frequency multi-channel, an attenuation factor is introduced to optimize the performance instability during training of the deep network. Finally, when the convergence and accuracy are compared, PRelu and Adabound are used instead of the Relu activation function and the Adam optimizer. The experimental results revealed that our method’s average recognition accuracy was 97.96%, and the detection time for a single image was 0.278 seconds. The average detection accuracy has been increased. The method lays the groundwork for the precise control of maize diseases in the field. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adam Protein; Article; Decomposition; Feature Extraction; Filtration; Image Analysis; Maize; Nonhuman; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Leaves; Zea Mays","ADAM protein; Article; decomposition; feature extraction; filtration; image analysis; maize; nonhuman; plant disease; plant leaf; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Leaves; Zea mays",,,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,"Iqbal, Zahid, An automated detection and classification of citrus plant diseases using image processing techniques: A review, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 153, pp. 12-32, (2018); Saeed, Farah, Deep neural network features fusion and selection based on PLS regression with an application for crops diseases classification, Applied Soft Computing, 103, (2021); Zhang, Ming, Surface defect detection of navel orange based on region adaptive brightness correction algorithm, Scientia Agricultura Sinica, 53, 12, pp. 2360-2370, (2020); Singh, Vijai, Detection of plant leaf diseases using image segmentation and soft computing techniques, Information Processing in Agriculture, 4, 1, pp. 41-49, (2017); Khirade, Sachin D., Plant disease detection using image processing, pp. 768-771, (2015); Chung, Chialing, Detecting Bakanae disease in rice seedlings by machine vision, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 121, pp. 404-411, (2016); Türkoǧlu, Muammer, Plant disease and pest detection using deep learning-based features, Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, 27, 3, pp. 1636-1651, (2019); Lecun, Yann Le, Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE, 86, 11, pp. 2278-2323, (1998); Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition, (2014); Szegedy, Christian, Going deeper with convolutions, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 07-12-June-2015, pp. 1-9, (2015)",,Public Library of Science,,,,,,19326203,,POLNC,35483023,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129324156

Accurate prediction of plant phosphorylation sites (p-sites) is vital as abnormal regulation of phosphorylation usually leads to plant diseases. However, current experimental methods for PTM prediction suffers from high-computational cost and are error-prone. The present study develops machine learning-based prediction techniques, including a high-performance interpretable deep tabular learning network (TabNet) to improve the prediction of protein p-sites in soybean. Moreover, we use a hybrid feature set of sequential-based features, physicochemical properties and position-specific scoring matrices to predict serine (Ser/S), threonine (Thr/T) and tyrosine (Tyr/Y) p-sites in soybean for the first time. The experimentally verified p-sites data of soybean proteins are collected from the eukaryotic phosphorylation sites database and database post-translational modification. We then remove the redundant set of positive and negative samples by dropping protein sequences with >40% similarity. It is found that the developed techniques perform >70% in terms of accuracy. The results demonstrate that the TabNet model is the best performing classifier using hybrid features and with window size of 13, resulted in 78.96 and 77.24% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The results indicate that the TabNet method has advantages in terms of high-performance and interpretability. The proposed technique can automatically analyze the data without any measurement errors and any human intervention. Furthermore, it can be used to predict putative protein p-sites in plants effectively.

In addition, salinization jeopardizes agroecosystems, inducing salt stress in most cultivated plants (nutrient deficiency, pH and oxidative stress, biomass reduction), and directly affects the quality and quantity of food production. Depending on the type of salt/stress (alkaline or pH-neutral), specific approaches and solutions should be applied to ameliorate the situation on-site. Various agro-hydrotechnical (soil and water conservation, reduced tillage, mulching, rainwater harvesting, irrigation and drainage, control of seawater intrusion), biological (agroforestry, multi-cropping, cultivation of salt-resistant species, bacterial inoculation, promotion of mycorrhiza, grafting with salt-resistant rootstocks), chemical (application of organic and mineral amendments, phytohormones), bio-ecological (breeding, desalination, application of nano-based products, seed biopriming), and/or institutional solutions (salinity monitoring, integrated national and regional strategies) are very effective against salinity/salt stress and numerous other constraints. Advances in computer science (artificial intelligence, machine learning) provide rapid predictions of salinization processes from the field to the global scale, under numerous scenarios, including climate change. Thus, these results represent a comprehensive outcome and tool for a multidisciplinary approach to protect and control salinization, minimizing damages caused by salt stress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Neutral And Alkaline Salinity; Plant–microbe Associations; Salinity And Nanotechnology; Salt Stress; Soil Amendments,,,,"Funding: The publication was supported by the Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Agriculture.","Song, Tingting, Metabolomic analysis of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) root-symbiotic rhizobia responses under alkali stress, Frontiers in Plant Science, 8, (2017); Ondrasek, Gabrijel, Humates and Chlorides Synergistically Increase Cd Phytoaccumulation in Strawberry Fruits, Heightening Health Risk from Cd in Human Diet, Exposure and Health, 14, 2, pp. 393-410, (2022); Zhao, Gan, Nitrate reductase-dependent nitric oxide is crucial for multi-walled carbon nanotube-induced plant tolerance against salinity, Nanoscale, 11, 21, pp. 10511-10523, (2019); Irrigation in Agroecosystems, (2019); Future of Food and Agriculture Alternative Pathways to 2050, (2018); Droughtdetection and Solutions, (2020); Gill, Sarvajeet Singh, Reactive oxygen species and antioxidant machinery in abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants, Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 48, 12, pp. 909-930, (2010); Abiotic Stress in Plants Mechanisms and Adaptations, (2011); Horney, Randy D., Development of practical site-specific management methods for reclaiming salt-affected soil, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 46, 1-3 SPEC.

These eukaryotic filamentous pathogens secrete effector proteins to facilitate plant infection. Fungi and oomycete pathogens have diverse infection strategies and their effectors generally do not share sequence homology. However, they occupy similar host environments, either the plant apoplast or plant cytoplasm, and, therefore, may share some unifying properties based on the requirements of these host compartments. Here, we exploit these biological signals and present the first classifier (EffectorP 3.0) that uses two machine-learning models: one trained on apoplastic effectors and one trained on cytoplasmic effectors. EffectorP 3.0 accurately predicts known apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors in fungal and oomycete secretomes with low estimated false-positive rates of 3 and 8%, respectively. Cytoplasmic effectors have a higher proportion of positively charged amino acids, whereas apoplastic effectors are enriched for cysteine residues. The combination of fungal and oomycete effectors in training leads to a higher number of predicted cytoplasmic effectors in biotrophic fungi. EffectorP 3.0 expands predicted effector repertoires beyond small, cysteine-rich secreted proteins in fungi and RxLR-motif containing secreted proteins in oomycetes. We show that signal peptide prediction is essential for accurate effector prediction, because EffectorP 3.0 recognizes a cytoplasmic signal also in intracellular, nonsecreted proteins. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fungus–plant Interactions; Oomycete–plant Interactions; Fungal Proteins; Fungal Protein; Cytoplasm; Fungus; Metabolism; Microbiology; Oomycetes; Plant; Plant Disease; Cytoplasm; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Plant Diseases; Plants,fungal protein; cytoplasm; fungus; metabolism; microbiology; Oomycetes; plant; plant disease; Cytoplasm; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Plant Diseases; Plants,,Fungal Proteins,J.

Modern agriculture is a constantly growing approach for agricultural advances and farming techniques. It becomes challenging for the farmers to satisfy our planet's evolving requirements and the expectations of merchants, customers, etc. Some of the challenges the farmers face are-(i) Dealing with climatic changes because of soil erosion and industry emissions (ii) Nutrient deficiency in the soil, caused by a shortage of crucial minerals such as potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus can result in reduced crop growth. (iii) Farmers make a mistake by cultivating the same crops year after year without experimenting with different varieties. They add fertilizers randomly without understanding the inferior quality or quantity. The paper aims to discover the best model for crop prediction, which can help farmers decide the type of crop to grow based on the climatic conditions and nutrients present in the soil. This paper compares popular algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier using two different criterions Gini and Entropy. Results reveal that Random Forest gives the highest accuracy among the three. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cultivation; Customer Satisfaction; Decision Trees; Developing Countries; Machine Learning; Nearest Neighbor Search; Nutrients; Soils; Best Model; Climatic Changes; Crop Growth; Industry Emissions; Inferior Quality; Modern Agricultures; Nitrogen And Phosphorus; Nutrient Deficiency; Primary Sources; Soil Erosion; Crops,Cultivation; Customer satisfaction; Decision trees; Developing countries; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Nutrients; Soils; Best model; Climatic changes; Crop growth; Industry emissions; Inferior quality; Modern agricultures; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Nutrient deficiency; Primary sources; Soil erosion; Crops,,,,"International Journal of Innovative Research in Electrical Electronics Instrumentation and Control Engineering, (2014); Suresh, A., Prediction of major crop yields of Tamilnadu using K-means and Modified KNN, pp. 88-93, (2018); Medar, Ramesh, Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques, (2019); Nishant, Potnuru Sai, Crop yield prediction based on indian agriculture using machine learning, (2020); Kalimuthu, M., Crop prediction using machine learning, pp. 926-932, (2020); Geetha, V., An Effective Crop Prediction Using Random Forest Algorithm, (2020); Pande, Shilpa Mangesh, Crop Recommender System Using Machine Learning Approach, pp. 1066-1071, (2021); Sellam, Veerappan, Prediction of crop yield using regression analysis, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 9, 38, (2016); International Journal of Engineering Research Technology Ijert Ncetesft2020, (2020); International Journal of Engineering Research Technology Ijert, (2020)",,IOP Publishing Ltd,,"1st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Computational Electronics and Communication System, AICECS 2021",,"Manipal, Virtual",176781,17426588; 17426596,9788394593742; 9781628905861,,,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124701224

Cassava is a second most provider of carbohydrates in Africa. It is a key food for people of Africa in very harsh conditions. According to United Nations (FAO) almost eighty percent farmers of sub Saharan Africa are growing cassava roots, but due to a variety of viral diseases the production of cassava is very low from last two years. With the help of data science, it is possible to diagnose and classify these types of viral diseases. Existing methods of disease detection require farmers to solicit the help of government-funded agricultural experts to visually inspect and diagnose the plants. Moreover, this process is labor-intensive, time taken, costly and impacting the production and supply cycle. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth. The dataset which we use in this research is taken from Kaggle competition 2020. Dataset contains 21397 images of cassava plants which belongs to five different classes i.e., Cassava Bacterial Blight, Cassava Brown Streak Disease, Cassava Green Mottle, Cassava Mosaic Disease and Healthy leaves. In this work we have used augmentation technique to increase the samples for classification and balancing the uneven distribution of data for all classes and used deep learning model efficiennetB3 for identification classification of diseases and got 83.03% overall accuracy on test dataset with more than 90% individual accuracy of each class. We have developed a graphical user interface for using the model in more efficient way with the aim to help the industry for prediction of diseases during its initial stages. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Augmentation; Computer Vision; Deep Learning; Disease Classification; Efficientnetb3; Image Processing; Plants Diseases; Agriculture; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Computer Vision; Deep Learning; Graphical User Interfaces; Image Classification; Learning Systems; Plants (botany); Statistical Tests; Augmentation; Disease Classification; Efficientnetb3; Images Processing; Leaf Classification; Leaf Disease; Learning Techniques; Plant Disease; Viral Disease; Classification (of Information),Agriculture; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer vision; Deep learning; Graphical user interfaces; Image classification; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Statistical tests; Augmentation; Disease classification; Efficientnetb3; Images processing; Leaf classification; Leaf disease; Learning techniques; Plant disease; Viral disease; Classification (of information),,,,"Jogekar, Ravindra Namdeorao, Summary of Leaf-based plant disease detection systems: A compilation of systematic study findings to classify the leaf disease classification schemes, pp. 745-750, (2020); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., Impact of dataset size and variety on the effectiveness of deep learning and transfer learning for plant disease classification, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 153, pp. 46-53, (2018); Sambasivam, G., A predictive machine learning application in agriculture: Cassava disease detection and classification with imbalanced dataset using convolutional neural networks, Egyptian Informatics Journal, 22, 1, pp. 27-34, (2021); International Journal of 3D Printing Technologies and Digital Industry, (2021); Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education Turcomat, (2021); Mathulaprangsan, Seksan, Cassava Leaf Disease Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks, (2021); Sangbamrung, Isaman, A novel automatic method for cassava disease classification using deep learning, Journal of Advances in Information Technology, 11, 4, pp. 241-248, (2020); Tarm Makinalar Bilimi Dergisi, (2011); Deep Learning for Detection Cassava Leaf Disease, (2020); Maryum, Alina, Cassava Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Neural Networks, pp. 32-37, (2021)",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"16th International Conference on Open Source Systems and Technologies, ICOSST 2022",,Lahore,186102,,9781665464772,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147714350

Cassava is loaded with carbohydrates and is mostly cultivated by small farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa as a security crop as it is capable of growing amidst drought which affects mostly all the other crops directly and adversely. At present, farmers are completely dependent on plant health experts to come and have a weekly or bi-weekly random inspection of the plants. They collect leaf samples from 3 different parts of the plant - top, middle, and lower parts and send them to the lab for testing. This takes up a lot of time and does not leave enough time for farmers to find a solution once the plants get affected. Therefore, it is important for farmers to detect the diseases as early as possible. To tackle this problem, we propose a disease detection model for cassava plants using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The features in the cassava plant images which signify the presence of disease will be automatically learned by the Neural Network. The farmers cannot detect these features manually. This research was conducted using a dataset of 21,397 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda comprising four diseases namely Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Green Mottle (CGM), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and the dataset also contains healthy images of the plant. Most of the images in this dataset were taken by farmers in their gardens to provide a realistic representation of how farmers would diagnose these diseases in real life. These images were annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Automation; Cassava Disease Recognition; Convolutional Neural Network (cnn); Deep Learning; Densenet; Disease Identification; Farmers; Image Classification; Survey; Transfer Learning; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Cultivation; Deep Learning; Plants (botany); Surveys; Transfer Learning; Cassavum Disease Recognition; Convolutional Neural Network; Densenet; Disease Identification; Farmer; Images Classification; Sub-saharan Africa; Image Classification,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Cultivation; Deep learning; Plants (botany); Surveys; Transfer learning; Cassavum disease recognition; Convolutional neural network; Densenet; Disease identification; Farmer; Images classification; Sub-saharan africa; Image classification,,,,"Nassar, Nagib M.A., Breeding cassava to feed the poor, Scientific American, 302, 5, pp. 78-84, (2010); Amelework, Assefa Beyene, Adoption and Promotion of Resilient Crops for Climate Risk Mitigation and Import Substitution: A Case Analysis of Cassava for South African Agriculture, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 5, (2021); Africa Renewal, (2006); Apsnet Features, (2011); Legg, James P., Cassava mosaic virus disease in East Africa: A dynamic disease in a changing environment, Virus Research, 71, 1-2, pp. 135-149, (2000); Maruthi, Midatharahally Narasegowda, A method for generating virus-free cassava plants to combat viral disease epidemics in Africa, Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology, 105, pp. 77-87, (2019); Ramcharan, Amanda M., Deep learning for image-based cassava disease detection, Frontiers in Plant Science, 8, (2017); Sladojević, Srdjan M., Deep Neural Networks Based Recognition of Plant Diseases by Leaf Image Classification, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2016, (2016); Sambasivam, G., A predictive machine learning application in agriculture: Cassava disease detection and classification with imbalanced dataset using convolutional neural networks, Egyptian Informatics Journal, 22, 1, pp. 27-34, (2021); Abayomi-Alli, Olusola Oluwakemi, Cassava disease recognition from low-quality images using enhanced data augmentation model and deep learning, Expert Systems, 38, 7, (2021)","Mittal, H.K.; Jain, V.; Polkowski, Z.",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"5th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Technologies, CCICT 2022",,Sonepat,183485,,9781665472241,,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141683104

Lime is rich 10 source of vitamin C which works as an immunity booster in human body. Because of the late and manually diseases detection in lime causes a vast loss in crop production worldwide. The most common diseases are found in limes are lime canker, lemon scab, brown rot, sooty mould and Armillaria. In this paper we used imaging and non-imaging (spectral based sensing) methods with the combination of machine learning technique to detect the lime canker and sooty mould diseases. Image acquirement, pre-processing, segmentation and classification are all steps in the imaging methodology, which is then followed by feature extraction. In non-imaging methodology a multispectral sensor (Spectrometer) is used with 400 nm to 1000 nm wavelength to detect the diseases. training set and test set ratio is fixed for both techniques are 75% and 25% respectively.

Although several remote sensing platforms are in use today, small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) provide the greatest flexibility with the highest resolution. As sUAS capabilities continue to increase (i.e., payload, flight time, and speed), their potential in commercial row crop production is substantial. However, like other forms of remote sensing, traditional sUAS are limited to a nadir view of the target and only capture the top of the crop canopy. Although disease epidemiology and stress origins vary, this limited view usually does not capture the impact of stress at the initial manifestation. For example, stresses such as macronutrient deficiencies in corn originate at the base of the plant and then move upward as nutrients translocate. By the time the stress is detectable at the top of the canopy, the opportunity to mitigate yield loss is limited. A new sUAS platform is needed for sensing beneath the upper portion of the canopy. The Stinger platform, developed to meet this need, consists of a 4.0 m fiberglass rod, custom sensor mount, communication network, and radio link. Using this platform, a variety of sensors can be inserted into the crop canopy from a hovering sUAS. The Stinger platform, when combined with artificial intelligence (AI), significantly expands the capabilities of sUAS for diagnosis of crop stress in row crop production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Intra-canopy Sensing; Remote Sensing; Rgb Imagery; Stress Diagnosis; Suas; Antennas; Crops; Cultivation; Diagnosis; Radio Links; Crop Canopy; Crop Production; Intra-canopy Sensing; New Approaches; Remote-sensing; Rgb Imagery; Row Crop; Small Unmanned Aerial System; Stress Diagnose; Unmanned Aerial Systems; Remote Sensing; Canopy; Growing Season; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing,Antennas; Crops; Cultivation; Diagnosis; Radio links; Crop canopy; Crop production; Intra-canopy sensing; New approaches; Remote-sensing; RGB imagery; Row crop; Small unmanned aerial system; Stress diagnose; Unmanned aerial systems; Remote sensing; canopy; growing season; precision agriculture; remote sensing,,,"We would like to thank the Ohio Soybean Council for funding this research, and Dr. Anne Dorrance, Andrew Klopfenstein, and Ryan Tietje for contributing their technical expertise to the project.","Corn Soybean Wheat and Forages Field Guide, (2019); Allen, Tom W., Soybean yield loss estimates due to diseases in the United States and Ontario, Canada, from 2010 to 2014, Plant Health Progress, 18, 1, pp. 19-27, (2017); VDI Berichte, (2013); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., A review on the main challenges in automatic plant disease identification based on visible range images, Biosystems Engineering, 144, pp. 52-60, (2016); Baret, Frédéric, Quantification of plant stress using remote sensing observations and crop models: The case of nitrogen management, Journal of Experimental Botany, 58, 4, pp. 869-880, (2007); Boulent, Justine, Convolutional Neural Networks for the Automatic Identification of Plant Diseases, Frontiers in Plant Science, 10, (2019); About the Program, (2020); Colomina, Ismael, Unmanned aerial systems for photogrammetry and remote sensing: A review, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 92, pp. 79-97, (2014); Integrated Pest Management Scouting in Field Crops, (2015); Deery, David M., Proximal remote sensing buggies and potential applications for field-based phenotyping, Agronomy, 4, 3, pp. 349-379, (2014)",,American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers,,,,,,27693287; 27693295,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136879547

Plant innate immunity relies on a broad repertoire of receptor proteins that can detect pathogens and trigger an effective defense response. Bioinformatic tools based on conserved domain and sequence similarity are within the most popular strategies for protein identification and characterization. However, the multi-domain nature, high sequence diversity and complex evolutionary history of disease resistance (DR) proteins make their prediction a real challenge. Here we present RFPDR, which pioneers the application of Random Forest (RF) for Plant DR protein prediction. Methods. A recently published collection of experimentally validated DR proteins was used as a positive dataset, while 10x10 nested datasets, ranging from 400-4,000 non-DR proteins, were used as negative datasets. A total of 9,631 features were extracted from each protein sequence, and included in a full dimension (FD) RFPDR model. Sequence selection was performed, to generate a reduced-dimension (RD) RFPDR model. Model performances were evaluated using an 80/20 (training/testing) partition, with 10- cross fold validation, and compared to baseline, sequence-based and state-of-the-art strategies. To gain some insights into the underlying biology, the most discriminatory sequence-based features in the RF classifier were identified. Results and Discussion. RD-RFPDR showed to be sensitive (86.4 ± 4.0%) and specific (96.9 ± 1.5%) for identifying DR proteins, while robust to data imbalance. Its high performance and robustness, added to the fact that RD-RFPDR provides valuable information related to DR proteins underlying properties, make RD-RFPDR an interesting approach for DR protein prediction, complementing the state-of-the-art strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Defense Response; Disease Resistance; Machine Learning; Plant Immunity; Random Forest; Plant Disease Resistance Protein; Plant Protein; Proteome; Unclassified Drug; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Area Under The Curve; Article; Barley; Disease Resistance; Feature Extraction; Japonica Rice; Machine Learning; Measurement Accuracy; Measurement Precision; Nonhuman; Plant Disease; Plant Immunity; Prediction; Random Forest; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Sensitivity And Specificity; Soybean; Tomato; Triticum Aestivum,plant disease resistance protein; plant protein; proteome; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis thaliana; area under the curve; Article; barley; disease resistance; feature extraction; Japonica rice; machine learning; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; nonhuman; plant disease; plant immunity; prediction; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; soybean; tomato; Triticum aestivum,,,"Diego Simón and Carla Valeria Filippi are funded by Comisión Académica de Posgrado, Universidad de la República, Uruguay.

Plant diseases are a huge problem in agriculture and incorporating machine learning algorithms for their early detection will help better yields and save the farmers from loses. This paper entails the use of such machine learning algorithms to detect leaf diseases in the cassava plant. Cassava is one of the largest sources of carbohydrates for the continent of Africa. It is also very vulnerable to several plant diseases; this in turn threatens the food security of the continent. The present study is based on four of such diseases that affect the cassava yield namely, Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), and Cassava Green Mottle (CGM). In this research work, EfficientNet-B0 is proposed for the early detection of these diseases. The EfficientNet-B0 models outperform existing CNNs in terms of accuracy and efficiency while reducing parameter size and FLOPS by an order of magnitude. It is easier to detect disease at an early stage without the assistance of professionals, saving farmers both time and money.

Growing plants at home have become a hobby as well as a nutrient factor. It also ensures that the vegetables and plants are pesticide-free and contain nutrients like antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals as a whole. But growing plants at home is not that easy as they get affected by different diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses which raise the need to identify them to prevent them from causing health issues to humans. This paper identifies the common diseases that affect vegetables like affect tomatoes, potatoes, corn, pepper leaves by using an android mobile application which is generally diagnosed by human visual confirmation. The Application allows gardeners to input the image of the diseased plant. The image is then converted and processed with the trained model against the common symptoms include water-soaked, gray-green spots, and dark circular spots. This process will be done by using a dataset which is a collection of all infected leaves images that will be processed through an image processing and train it by using CNN that extracts and learn the features. This project aims to help house-gardeners identify plant leaf diseases to ensure their health, raise the productivity and quality of plants.

The disease on the plant causes severe suffering to farmers economically. So, the plant disease is either to be controlled or predicted before it leads to big damages. To solve this issue, machine learning algorithms have been proposed to analyze the root causes of the disease and to prescribe suitable pesticides to cure the plant. Though many methods have been encountered to detect the disease of a crop, the existing methods failed to give accurate results. While many existing methods failed to apply image processing techniques and databases to store the crop data, the proposed CNN algorithm adopted these features by creating web applications to know the different types of disease that have occurred on the plant. The result witnesses that the proposed algorithms have shown improved accuracy (93.3%) which helps the farmer to raise the productivity of a crop. The developed app also helps young farmers to read and select suitable image options to improve the good yielding of their agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Detection; Machine Learning; Pattern Recognition; Plant Leaf Diseases; Convolutional Neural Networks; Image Enhancement; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Pattern Recognition; Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Detection; Human Being; Image Processing Technique; Leaf Disease; Machine Learning Algorithms; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf Disease; Plant Leaves; Root Cause; Crops,Convolutional neural networks; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Human being; Image processing technique; Leaf disease; Machine learning algorithms; Plant disease; Plant leaf disease; Plant leaves; Root cause; Crops,,,"Sincere thanks to Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science (Deemed to be University), Padur, Kelampakkam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.","Journal of Innovative Image Processing Jiip, (2020); Journal of Innovative Image Processing Jiip, (2021); Journal of Soft Computing Paradigm Jscp, (2020); Journal of Artificial Intelligence, (2019); Atila, Umit, Plant leaf disease classification using EfficientNet deep learning model, Ecological Informatics, 61, (2021); Owomugisha, Godliver, Machine learning for plant disease incidence and severity measurements from leaf images, pp. 158-163, (2017); Shi, Yun, PNN based crop disease recognition with leaf image features and meteorological data, International Journal of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, 8, 4, pp. 60-68, (2015); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., Digital image processing techniques for detecting, quantifying and classifying plant diseases, SpringerPlus, 2, 1, pp. 1-12, (2013); Sherly Puspha Annabel, L., Machine learning for plant leaf disease detection and classification - A review, pp. 538-542, (2019); Zhen, Xiantong, Direct estimation of cardiac bi-ventricular volumes with regression forests, Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Clinical equipment is required to measure micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamins using existing clinical methods. In rural and low-income areas, there is a tradeoff between infrastructure, precision, invasiveness, and cost. Invasive blood sampling in paediatric patients is more uncomfortable, in addition to being cost prohibitive. There is a link between micronutrient deficiencies and subjective assessments of anatomical regions like finger nail beds. Artificial intelligence can detect micronutrient deficiency by looking at the colour and metadata of the fingernails. Convolutional neural network models are used in the proposed deep learning model to extract the features of the nails and predict the corresponding deficiencies. Various architectures such as ResNet, SqueezeNet, DenseNet, VGG and custom model are used to detect cutaneous abnormalities such as Melanonychia, Mycotic, and Buea's lines. The realtime images are used to train the model, which is then validated with sample images for increased accuracy. With images collected from web crawlers, the proposed non-invasive model has an accuracy of 94%, and performance can be further improved by training with large variants of data and data augmentation.

The small RNAs (sRNAs) of Magnaporthe oryzae use the RNAi mechanism of rice to realize the infection process, and different effector proteins can increase the autotoxicity by inhibiting pathogen-associated molecular patterns triggered immunity (PTI) to achieve the purpose of infection. However, the coordination of sRNAs and proteins in the process of M. oryzae infecting rice is still poorly understood. Therefore, the combination of transcriptomics and proteomics to study the mechanism of M. oryzae infecting rice has important theoretical significance and practical value for controlling rice diseases and improving rice yields. In this paper, we used the high-throughput data of various omics before and after the M. oryzae infecting rice to screen differentially expressed genes and sRNAs and predict protein interaction pairs based on the interolog and the domain-domain methods. We were then used to construct a prediction model of the M. oryzae-rice interaction proteins according to the obtained proteins in the proteomic network. Finally, for the differentially expressed genes, differentially expressed sRNAs, the corresponding mRNAs of rice and M. oryzae, and the interacting protein molecules, the M. oryzae-rice sRNA regulatory network was built and analyzed, the core nodes were selected. The functional enrichment analysis was conducted to explore the potential effect pathways and the critical infection factors of M. oryzae sRNAs and proteins were mined and analyzed. The results showed that 22 sRNAs of M. oryzae, 77 secretory proteins of M. oryzae were used as effect factors to participate in the infection process of M. oryzae. And many significantly enriched GO modules were discovered, which were related to the infection mechanism of M. oryzae. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Machine Learning; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Multi-omics; Protein; Rice; Srna; Transfer Rna; Asparagine Linked Oligosaccharide; Messenger Rna; Myelin Associated Glycoprotein; Secretory Protein; Transfer Rna; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Biogenesis; Data Processing; Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane; Functional Enrichment Analysis; Gene Expression; Gene Silencing; Genomics; Machine Learning; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Mycosis; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Excision Repair; Plant Disease; Plant Yield; Protein Domain; Protein Expression; Protein Metabolism; Protein Protein Interaction; Proteomics; Purine Metabolism; Pyrimidine Metabolism; Rice; Rna Interference; Transcriptomics,asparagine linked oligosaccharide; messenger RNA; myelin associated glycoprotein; secretory protein; transfer RNA; amino acid sequence; Article; biogenesis; data processing; endoplasmic reticulum membrane; functional enrichment analysis; gene expression; gene silencing; genomics; machine learning; Magnaporthe oryzae; mycosis; nonhuman; nucleotide excision repair; plant disease; plant yield; protein domain; protein expression; protein metabolism; protein protein interaction; proteomics; purine metabolism; pyrimidine metabolism; rice; RNA interference; transcriptomics,,"transfer RNA, 9014-25-9",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62072210).,"Cai, Qiang, Cross-kingdom RNA trafficking and environmental RNAi — nature's blueprint for modern crop protection strategies, Current Opinion in Microbiology, 46, pp. 58-64, (2018); Chang, Haowu, Identification of novel Phytophthora infestans small RNAs involved in potato late blight reveals potential cross-kingdom regulation to facilitate oomycete infection, International Journal of Data Mining and Bioinformatics, 23, 2, pp. 119-141, (2020); Chujo, Tetsuya, OsWRKY28, a PAMP-responsive transrepressor, negatively regulates innate immune responses in rice against rice blast fungus, Plant Molecular Biology, 82, 1-2, pp. 23-37, (2013); Cui, Chen, A Brassica miRNA Regulates Plant Growth and Immunity through Distinct Modes of Action, Molecular Plant, 13, 2, pp. 231-245, (2020); Deng, Yizhen, Metabolic basis of pathogenesis and host adaptation in rice blast, Annual Review of Microbiology, 73, pp. 601-619, (2019); Faso, Carmen, A missense mutation in the arabidopsis copii coat protein sec24a induces the formation of clusters of the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus, Plant Cell, 21, 11, pp. 3655-3671, (2009); Grenville-Briggs, Laura J., Elevated amino acid biosynthesis in Phytophthora infestans during appressorium formation and potato infection, Fungal Genetics and Biology, 42, 3, pp. 244-256, (2005); Grohmann, Ursula, Control of immune response by amino acid metabolism, Immunological Reviews, 236, 1, pp. 243-264, (2010); Großkinsky, Dominik K., Integration of multi-omics techniques and physiological phenotyping within a holistic phenomics approach to study senescence in model and crop plants, Journal of Experimental Botany, 69, 4, pp. 825-844, (2018); Imam, Jahangir, Molecular Diversity and Mating Type Distribution of the Rice Blast Pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae in North-East and Eastern India, Indian Journal of Microbiology, 55, 1, pp. 108-113, (2015)",,Frontiers Media S.A.,,,,,,16648021,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120436247

Recent breakthroughs in protein structure modeling have demonstrated the feasibility to predict the protein folds without depending on homologous templates. These advances enabled a genome-wide computational structural biology approach to help understand proteins based on their predicted folds. In this study, we employed structure prediction methods on the secretome of the destructive fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Out of 1,854 secreted proteins, we predicted the folds of 1,295 proteins (70%). We showed that template-free modeling by TrRosetta captured 514 folds missed by homology modeling, including many known effectors and virulence factors, and that TrRosetta generally produced higher quality models for secreted proteins. Along with sensitive homology search, we employed structure-based clustering, defining not only homologous groups with divergent members but also sequence-unrelated structurally analogous groups. We demonstrate that this approach can reveal new putative members of structurally similar MAX effectors and novel analogous effector families present in M. oryzae and possibly in other phytopathogens. We also investigated the evolution of expanded putative ADP-ribose transferases with predicted structures. We suggest that the loss of catalytic activities of the enzymes might have led them to new evolutionary trajectories to be specialized as protein binders. Collectively, we propose that computational structural genomics approaches can be an integral part of studying effector biology and provide valuable resources that were inaccessible before the advent of machine learning-based structure prediction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computational Structural Genomics; Effectors; Fungal Effectors; Fungus–plant Interactions; Genomics; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Phytopathogen; Structure; Fungal Proteins; Fungal Protein; Ascomycetes; Genetics; Genomics; Magnaporthe; Metabolism; Oryza; Plant Disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Genomics; Plant Diseases; Secretome,fungal protein; Ascomycetes; genetics; genomics; Magnaporthe; metabolism; Oryza; plant disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Genomics; Plant Diseases; Secretome,,Fungal Proteins,"Funding: This research relied on the Savio computational cluster resource provided by the Berkeley Research Computing program at the University of California, Berkeley.

Despite this, plant diseases and unfavorable weather patterns continue to threaten the delicate balance between vegetable production and consumption. It is critical to utilize machine learning (ML) in this setting because it provides context for decision-making related to breeding goals. Cutting-edge technologies for crop genome sequencing and phenotyping, combined with advances in computer science, are currently fueling a revolution in vegetable science and technology. Additionally, various ML techniques such as prediction, classification, and clustering are frequently used to forecast vegetable crop production in the field. In the vegetable seed industry, machine learning algorithms are used to assess seed quality before germination and have the potential to improve vegetable production with desired features significantly; whereas, in plant disease detection and management, the ML approaches can improve decision-support systems that assist in converting massive amounts of data into valuable recommendations. On similar lines, in vegetable breeding, ML approaches are helpful in predicting treatment results, such as what will happen if a gene is silenced. Furthermore, ML approaches can be a saviour to insufficient coverage and noisy data generated using various omics platforms.

The disease is highly destructive, because it produces latent asymptomatic infections that favor contagion rates. The present research aims consisted on the implementation of Raman spectroscopy (RS) and machine-learning spectral analysis as a method for the early disease detection. Raman spectra were obtained from infected asymptomatic tomato plants (BCTo) and healthy controls (HTo) with 785 nm excitation laser micro-Raman spectrometer. Spectral data were normalized and processed by principal component analysis (PCA), then the classifiers algorithms multilayer perceptron (PCA + MLP) and linear discriminant analysis (PCA + LDA) were implemented. Bacterial isolation and identification (16S rRNA gene sequencing) were realized of each plant studied. The Raman spectra obtained from tomato leaf samples of HTo and BCTo exhibited peaks associated to cellular components, and the most prominent vibrational bands were assigned to carbohydrates, carotenoids, chlorophyll, and phenolic compounds. Biochemical changes were also detectable in the Raman spectral patterns. Raman bands associated with triterpenoids and flavonoids compounds can be considered as indicators of Cmm infection during the asymptomatic stage. RS is an efficient, fast and reliable technology to differentiate the tomato health condition (BCTo or HTo). The analytical method showed high performance values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, among others. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Clavibacter Michiganensis Subsp.

Recent studies with remote sensing (RS) sensors at different scales have shown that Xf-infected olive trees have distinct spectral features in the visible and infrared regions (VNIR). However, further work is needed to integrate remote sensing in the management of plant disease epidemics. Here, we research how the spectral changes picked up by different sets of RS plant traits (i.e., pigments, structural or leaf protein content), can help capture the spatial dynamics of Xf spread. We coupled a spatial spread model with the probability of Xf-infection predicted by a RS-driven support vector machine (RS-SVM) model. Furthermore, we analyzed which RS plant traits contribute most to the output of the prediction models. For that, in almond orchards affected by Xf (n = 1426 trees), we conducted a field campaign simultaneously with an airborne campaign to collect high-resolution thermal images and hyperspectral images in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400–850 nm) and short-wave infrared regions (SWIR, 950–1700 nm). The best performing RS-SVM model (OA = 75%; kappa = 0.50) included as predictors leaf protein content, nitrogen indices (NIs), fluorescence and a thermal indicator (T<inf>c</inf>), alongside pigments and structural parameters. Leaf protein content together with NIs contributed 28% to the explanatory power of the model, followed by chlorophyll (22%), structural parameters (LAI and LIDF<inf>a</inf>), and chlorophyll indicators of photosynthetic efficiency. Coupling the RS model with an epidemic spread model increased the accuracy (OA = 80%; kappa = 0.48). In the almond trees where the presence of Xf was assayed by qPCR (n = 318 trees), the combined RS-spread model yielded an OA of 71% and kappa = 0.33, which is higher than the RS-only model and visual inspections (both OA = 64–65% and kappa = 0.26–31). Our work demonstrates how combining spatial epidemiological models and remote sensing can lead to highly accurate predictions of plant disease spatial distribution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Epidemic Spread Model; Hyperspectral; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; Radiative Transfer Model; Swir Domain; Thermal; Xylella Fastidiosa; Bacteria; Chlorophyll; Epidemiology; Forestry; Infrared Devices; Infrared Radiation; Nitrogen; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Probability Distributions; Proteins; Remote Sensing; Support Vector Machines; Viruses; Epidemic Spread Model; Hyperspectral; Leaf Proteins; Machine-learning; Plant Traits; Radiative Transfer Modelling; Remote-sensing; Swir Domain; Thermal; Xylella Fastidiosa; Radiative Transfer; Detection Method; Disease Spread; Disinfection; Ecological Modeling; Epidemic; Host-pathogen Interaction; Infectious Disease; Orchard; Remote Sensing; Spatial Distribution; Indicator Indicator; Prunus Dulcis,Bacteria; Chlorophyll; Epidemiology; Forestry; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Nitrogen; Polymerase chain reaction; Probability distributions; Proteins; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Viruses; Epidemic spread model; HyperSpectral; Leaf proteins; Machine-learning; Plant traits; Radiative transfer modelling; Remote-sensing; SWIR domain; Thermal; Xylella fastidiosa; Radiative transfer; detection method; disease spread; disinfection; ecological modeling; epidemic; host-pathogen interaction; infectious disease; orchard; remote sensing; spatial distribution; Indicator indicator; Prunus dulcis,,,"Funding text 1: Data collection was partially supported by the European Union 's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program through grant agreements POnTE ( 635646 ) and XF-ACTORS ( 727987 ).

Vegetable farming is one of the wide-scale businesses across the world. Many times, Vegetable plants are attacked by different diseases which consequences a heavy deficit for farmers. Early prognosis of these plant diseases can help to overcome this loss. Due to the variation of these diseases, it is difficult to identify the attacking disease. Deep learning models can be used for early detection of these diseased plants and appropriate measurements can be taken to minimize deficit. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based model for the early prognosis and classification of plant diseases. We have tuned a deep learning-based pretrained model in 2 folds over a publicly available dataset that contains images of different plants suffering from different diseases as well as healthy plants. We are envisioned to classify each instance as healthy or the name of the disease, the plant is being suffered. This transfer learning method has achieved remarkable results on this data-set of tomato plants and achieved 98.89% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this model is lightweight than other states of the art model with such significant results. This deep learning-based system can be used in real life for the detection of diseases of plants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Image Classification; Mobilenet; Plant Disease Classification; Transfer Learning; Diagnosis; Learning Systems; Optimization; Transfer Learning; Vegetables; Art Model; Learning Based Models; Learning Models; Physical Health; Plant Disease; Robust Optimization; Tomato Plants; Transfer Learning Methods; Deep Learning,Diagnosis; Learning systems; Optimization; Transfer learning; Vegetables; ART model; Learning Based Models; Learning models; Physical health; Plant disease; Robust optimization; Tomato plants; Transfer learning methods; Deep learning,,,"Authors pay their thanks to Intelligent Criminology Lab, National Center For Artificial Intelligence, Al-Khawarizimi Institute of Computer Science, UET Lahore for providing research platform, technical support, and financial assistance.","Savary, Serge, The global burden of pathogens and pests on major food crops, Nature Ecology and Evolution, 3, 3, pp. 430-439, (2019); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., A review on the main challenges in automatic plant disease identification based on visible range images, Biosystems Engineering, 144, pp. 52-60, (2016); García-Floriano, Andrés, A machine learning approach to medical image classification: Detecting age-related macular degeneration in fundus images, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 75, pp. 218-229, (2019); Zhao, Wenzhi, Spectral-Spatial Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Image Classification: A Dimension Reduction and Deep Learning Approach, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 54, 8, pp. 4544-4554, (2016); Khan, Muhammad Zeeshan, A Realistic Image Generation of Face from Text Description Using the Fully Trained Generative Adversarial Networks, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 1250-1260, (2021); Khan, Gulraiz, Blockchain-enabled deep semantic video-to-video summarization for IoT devices, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 81, (2020); Mustafa, M.

The essential nutrients like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen are obtained from sunlight, air, and water to prepare food and plant growth. For healthy growth, plants also need macronutrients such as Potassium, Calcium, Nitrogen, Sulphur, Magnesium, and Phosphorus in relatively great quantities. When a plant doesn’t find necessary nutrients for its growth inadequate amount, deficiency of plant nutrients occur. Plants exhibit various symptoms to indicate the deficiency. Automatic identification and differentiation of these deficiencies are very important in the greenhouse environment. Deep Neural Networks are extremely efficient in image categorization problems. In this work, we used the part of the pre-trained deep learning model i.e. Transfer Learning model to detect the nutrient stress in the plant. We compared three different architectures including Inception-V3, ResNet50, and VGG16 with two classifiers: RF and SVM to improve, classification accuracy. A total of 880 images of Calcium and Magnesium deficiencies in the Tomato plant from the greenhouse were collected to form a dataset. For training, 704(80%) images are used and for testing, 176(20%) images are used to examine the model performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the largest accuracy of 99.14% has resulted for the VGG16 model with SVM classifier and 98.71% for Inception-V3 with Random Forest Classifier. For a batch size of 8 and epochs equal to 10, the Inception -V3 architecture attained the highest validation accuracy of 99.99% and the least validation loss of 0.0000384 on an average. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Neural Networks; Nutrient Deficiency; Plant Nutrients; Random Forest (rf); Support Vector Machine (svm); Transfer Learning; Decision Trees; Deep Neural Networks; Fruits; Greenhouses; Network Architecture; Support Vector Machines; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Essential Nutrients; Learning Models; Nutrient Deficiency; Plant Nutrients; Random Forest; Random Forests; Support Vector Machine; Support Vectors Machine; Tomato Plants; Transfer Learning; Nutrients,Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Fruits; Greenhouses; Network architecture; Support vector machines; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Essential nutrients; Learning models; Nutrient deficiency; Plant nutrients; Random forest; Random forests; Support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Tomato plants; Transfer learning; Nutrients,,,"We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the management of the BNM Institute of Technology, Bengaluru for providing us with all the necessary sources to accomplish this work and all the support to do the subsequent publications.

As the Indian population increasing day by day, the demand of increasing food production is also increasing to. The total area to under cultivation decreasing over the past years. Thirteen essential minerals and nutrients are requiring to grow and survival of plants and crops. All this nutrient is supplied from the soil. If adequate nutrients are not supplied to the plant, it will affect the growth and quality of plant. Nutrients are very important for the plant growth, 13 essential nutrients required for plant survive and growth. These nutrients are taken from soil. Soil nutrients deficiency affects the quality and growth of the plants. Nutrients deficiency symptoms always visible in the plant leaves. These symptoms are like leaf colour and textures, interveinal chlorosis, uniform chlorosis, marginal chlorosis, necrosis, distorted edges, reduction in size of the leaf, etc. Nutrient deficiency symptoms seen on the old and new leaves are different for different nutrients. Mineral nutrients are classified into macro and micronutrients. For plant survival, large amount of macronutrients and small amount of micronutrients are required. Macronutrients and micronutrients nutrients are essential to the plant, but excessive use of nutrients harms the crop production as well as wastage of money. To increase crop production with proper amount of nutrition need to be feed up to the plant at hungry stage. Excessive use of fertilizer creates so many problems like soil pollution, soil hardness, loss of foreign currency, etc. Early stage nutritional detection system can give sufficient time to use organic fertilizer which helps in pH balance and land preparation cost. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Image Processings; Nutrients; Sensor Technology; Sensors; Smart Agriculture; Svm Etc,,,,"This proposed work in this paper is contributed to the R&D in Parul University, India.

The small secretory proteins, explicitly known as effector proteins, are one of the prime mechanisms of host manipulation utilized by the pathogen to disarm the host. Several effector proteins are known to translocate from fungus to the plant cell for host manipulation. Many fungal effectors have been identified using genomic, transcriptomic, and bioinformatics approaches. Most of the effector proteins are devoid of any conserved signatures, and their prediction based on sequence homology is very challenging, therefore by combining the sequence consensus based upon machine learning features, multiple tools have also been developed for predicting apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors. Various post-genomics approaches like transcriptomics of virulent isolates have also been utilized for identifying active consortia of effectors. Significant progress has been made in understanding biotrophic effectors; however, most of it is underway due to their complex interaction with host and complicated recognition and signaling networks.

Alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms of the same gene may sometimes have very similar sequence, but they can have significantly diverse effects on cellular function and regulation. The products of alternative splicing have important and diverse functional roles, such as response to environmental stress, regulation of gene expression, human heritable, and plant diseases. The mRNA isoforms of the same gene can have dramatically different functions. Despite the functional importance of mRNA isoforms, very little has been done to annotate their functions. The recent years have however seen the development of several computational methods aimed at predicting mRNA isoform level biological functions. These methods use a wide array of proteo-genomic data to develop machine learning-based mRNA isoform function prediction tools. In this review, we discuss the computational methods developed for predicting the biological function at the individual mRNA isoform level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative Splicing; Deep Learning; Gene Ontology; Machine Learning; Mrna Isoforms; Multiple Instance Learning; Recommender Systems; Rna-seq; Rna Isoforms; Rna, Messenger; Rna Isoform; Messenger Rna; Alternative Rna Splicing; Computer Model; Deep Neural Network; Gene Interaction; Gene Ontology; Instance Oriented Multiple Instance Label Propagation; Learning Algorithm; Machine Learning; Matrix Factorization; Multiple Instance Learning; Nonhuman; Protein Expression; Review; Rna Sequencing; Support Vector Machine; Tissue Specific Mrna Isoform Functional Network; Animal; Biology; Gene Regulatory Network; Genetics; Human; Metabolism; Procedures; Alternative Splicing; Animals; Computational Biology; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Machine Learning; Rna Isoforms; Rna, Messenger","RNA isoform; messenger RNA; alternative RNA splicing; computer model; deep neural network; gene interaction; gene ontology; Instance Oriented Multiple Instance Label Propagation; learning algorithm; machine learning; matrix factorization; multiple instance learning; nonhuman; protein expression; Review; RNA sequencing; support vector machine; tissue specific mRNA isoform functional network; animal; biology; gene regulatory network; genetics; human; metabolism; procedures; Alternative Splicing; Animals; Computational Biology; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Machine Learning; RNA Isoforms; RNA, Messenger",,"RNA Isoforms; RNA, Messenger",,"Biomed Rep, (2015); Koren, Eli, The emergence of alternative 3′ and 5′ splice site exons from constitutive exons, PLOS Computational Biology, 3, 5, pp. 0895-0908, (2007); Keren, Hadas, Alternative splicing and evolution: Diversification, exon definition and function, Nature Reviews Genetics, 11, 5, pp. 345-355, (2010); Graveley, Brenton R., The developmental transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster, Nature, 471, 7339, pp. 473-479, (2011); Syed, Naeem Hasan, Alternative splicing in plants - coming of age, Trends in Plant Science, 17, 10, pp. 616-623, (2012); Stepankiw, Nicholas, Widespread alternative and aberrant splicing revealed by lariat sequencing, Nucleic Acids Research, 43, 17, pp. 8488-8501, (2015); Bitton, Danny Asher, Widespread exon skipping triggers degradation by nuclear RNA surveillance in fission yeast, Genome Research, 25, 6, pp. 884-896, (2015); Menon, Rajasree, Functional implications of structural predictions for alternative splice proteins expressed in Her2/neu-induced breast cancers, Journal of Proteome Research, 10, 12, pp. 5503-5511, (2011); Stamm, Stefan, Function of alternative splicing, Gene, 344, pp. 1-20, (2005); Kurokawa, Ken, Brief naturalistic stress induces an alternative splice variant of SMG-1 lacking exon 63 in peripheral leukocytes, Neuroscience Letters, 484, 2, pp. 128-132, (2010)",,MDPI AG rasetti@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005,,,,,,14220067; 16616596,,,32784445,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089408455

Plant diseases affect the economy of the country and also reduce the quality of agricultural product. Throughout the world, grapes are treated as a major fruit source, which contains nutrients like vitamin C. Diseases in the grape plants seriously affect the quality and production of grapes. Computer vision-based techniques have been used successfully in the last decades, to detect and classify the plants diseases. This paper deals with the identification and classification of diseases in grape leaves by using artificial bee colony (ABC) based feature selection. Initially the input images are applied with pre-processing steps which eliminate noises and background of the images. The features of color, texture and shape are extracted. ABC based attribute selection is used to find the optimal feature set. The selected features are given to the support vector machine classifier for foliar disease detection of grapes. The proposed method is experimented and compared with the other feature selection algorithms. The comparison results depict, the efficacy of the proposed method through the performance metrics such as recall, precision and classification accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Bee Colony; Disease Detection; Feature Selection; Grape Leaf; Agricultural Products; Optimization; Plants (botany); Support Vector Machines; Textures; Artificial Bee Colonies; Artificial Bee Colonies (abc); Artificial Bee Colony Optimizations; Classification Accuracy; Disease Detection; Feature Selection Algorithm; Grape Leaf; Support Vector Machine Classifiers; Feature Extraction,Agricultural products; Optimization; Plants (botany); Support vector machines; Textures; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Artificial bee colony optimizations; Classification accuracy; Disease detection; Feature selection algorithm; Grape leaf; Support vector machine classifiers; Feature extraction,,,,"Kadir, Abdul, A model of plant identification system using GLCM, lacunarity and shen features, Research Journal of Pharmaceutical, Biological and Chemical Sciences, 5, 2, pp. 1-10, (2014); Andrushia, A.

Additionally, pulses are important sources of soil nitrogen in rotational cropping systems. However, pulse production is limited by several biotic and abiotic stress factors. One such disease is Ascochyta blight (Ascochyta rabiei) in chickpea. To minimize the impact of Ascochyta blight, timely information on disease outbreak and epidemics is essential for implementing disease control methods. Thus, in this study, the feasibility of monitoring Ascochyta blight disease severity in chickpea using remote sensing techniques was evaluated. Disease severity was monitored using an unmanned aircraft system integrated with different types of sensors (3-band multispectral, 5-band multispectral, and thermal cameras). Results indicated that different flight altitudes (60 m and 90 m above ground level) that lead to different image resolutions did not influence disease detection efficiency, especially with the 3-band camera. Selected image features, including canopy area, percentage of canopy area, and vegetation indices (e.g., green normalized difference vegetation index) from multispectral cameras, and mean canopy temperature from the thermal camera, were significantly correlated with yield and visual ratings of disease severity. Moreover, hyperspectral sensing was found to be useful in predicting disease severity. In summary, this study demonstrated that disease severity of Ascochyta blight in chickpea can be monitored using remote sensing methods under active field conditions. With timely and accurate disease severity information from high-throughput phenotyping technologies, the effects of Ascochyta blight on chickpea yield and quality can be minimized with timely application of proper management techniques. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Feature Extraction; Hyperspectral Sensing; Remote Sensing; Unmanned Aerial System; Cropping Practice; Disease Control; Disease Severity; Fungal Disease; Legume; Ndvi; Phenotype; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Sensor; Soil Nitrogen; Ascochyta; Cicer Arietinum; Mycosphaerella Rabiei,cropping practice; disease control; disease severity; fungal disease; legume; NDVI; phenotype; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sensor; soil nitrogen; Ascochyta; Cicer arietinum; Mycosphaerella rabiei,,,"This activity was funded by US Department of Agriculture (USDA) - National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Project WNP06825 (accession number 1011741 ) and Hatch Project WNP00011 (accession number 1014919 ).

Citrus is a major plant grown mainly in the tropical areas of the world due to its richness in vitamin C and other important nutrients. The production of the citrus fruit has been widely affected by citrus diseases which ultimately degrades the fruit quality and causes financial loss to the growers. During the past decade, image processing and computer vision methods have been broadly adopted for the detection and classification of plant diseases. Early detection of diseases in citrus plants helps in preventing them to spread in the orchards which minimize the financial loss to the farmers. In this article, an image dataset citrus fruits, leaves, and stem is presented. The dataset holds citrus fruits and leaves images of healthy and infected plants with diseases such as Black spot, Canker, Scab, Greening, and Melanose. Most of the images were captured in December from the Orchards in Sargodha region of Pakistan when the fruit was about to ripen and maximum diseases were found on citrus plants. The dataset is hosted by the Department of Computer Science, University of Gujrat and acquired under the mutual cooperation of the University of Gujrat and the Citrus Research Center, Government of Punjab, Pakistan. The dataset would potentially be helpful to researchers who use machine learning and computer vision algorithms to develop computer applications to help farmers in early detection of plant diseases.

Nutrient deficiency is the cause of serious diseases in plant growth, affecting crop yield. In this article, we employed artificial neural network models to recognize, classify, and predict the nutritional deficiencies occurring in tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.). To classify and predict the different macronutrient deficiencies in the cropping process, this paper handles the captured images of the macronutrient deficiency. This deficiency during the fruiting and leafing phases of tomato plant are based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). A total of 571 images were captured with tomato leaves and fruits containing the crop species at the growth stage. Among all images, 80% (461 captured images) were used for the training dataset and 20% (110 captured images) were applied for the validation dataset. In this study, we provide an analysis of two different model architectures based on convolutional neural network for classifying and predicting the nutrient deficiency symptoms. For instance, Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder with the captured images of tomato plant growth under the greenhouse conditions. Moreover, a major type of statistical structure, namely Ensemble Averaging, was applied with two aforementioned predictive models to increase the accuracy of predictive validation. Three mineral nutrients, i.e., Calcium/Ca2+, Potassium/K+, and Nitrogen/N, are considered for use in evaluating the nutrient status in the development of tomato plant with these models. The aim of this study is to predict the nutrient deficiency accurately in order to increase crop production and prevent the emergence of tomato pathology caused by lack of nutrients. The predictive performance of the three models in this paper are validated, with the accuracy rates of 87.273% and 79.091% for Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder, respectively, and with 91% validity using Ensemble Averaging. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Autoencoder; Classification; Deep Learning; Ensemble Averaging; Inception-resnet V2; Nutrient Deficiency; Prediction; Tomato Plant,,,,"Funding: This work was supported by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE, South Korea) under Industrial Technology Innovation Program (No. 10062368).","Ho, Lim Chuen, A cellular hypothesis for the induction of blossom-end rot in tomato fruit, Annals of Botany, 95, 4, pp. 571-581, (2005); Morard, Philippe, Effect of temporary calcium deficiency on tomato growth and mineral nutrition, Journal of Plant Nutrition, 19, 1, pp. 115-127, (1996); Pujos, A., Effects of potassium deficiency on tomato growth and mineral nutrition at the early production stage, Plant and Soil, 189, 2, pp. 189-196, (1997); J Hort Sci, (1978); Bénard, Camille, Impact of temporary nitrogen deprivation on tomato leaf phenolics, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 12, 11, pp. 7971-7981, (2011); Lecun, Yann Le, Deep learning, Nature, 521, 7553, pp. 436-444, (2015); Liakos, Konstantinos G., Machine learning in agriculture: A review, Sensors, 18, 8, (2018); Kamilaris, Andreas, Deep learning in agriculture: A survey, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 147, pp. 70-90, (2018); Ictact J Image Video Process, (2017); J Nanophotobiosciences, (2014)",,MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com,,,,,,20763417,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067101930

Considering that the experimental identification of plant-pathogen PPIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, computationalmethods are emerging as an important strategy to complement the experimentalmethods. In this work, we first evaluated the performance of traditional computationalmethods such as interolog, domain-domain interaction and domain-motif interaction in predicting known plant-pathogen PPIs. Owing to the low sensitivity of the traditionalmethods, we utilized RandomForest to build an interspecies PPI predictionmodel based onmultiple sequence encodings and novel network attributes in the established plant PPI network. Critical assessment of the features demonstrated that the integration of sequence information and network attributes resulted in significant and robust performance improvement. Additionally, we also discussed the influence of Gene Ontology and gene expression information on the prediction performance. TheWeb server implementing the integrated predictionmethod, named InterSPPI, has beenmade freely available at http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/intersppi/index.php. InterSPPI could achieve a reasonably high accuracy with a precision of 73.8% and a recall of 76.6% in the independent test. To examine the applicability of InterSPPI, we also conducted cross-species and proteome-wide plant-pathogen PPI prediction tests. Taken together, we hope this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of the current status of plant-pathogen PPI predictions, and the proposed InterSPPI can become a useful tool to accelerate the exploration of plant-pathogen interactions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature Integration; Machine Learning; Plant-pathogen Interaction; Prediction; Protein-protein Interaction; Arabidopsis Proteins; Plant Proteins; Arabidopsis Protein; Plant Protein; Algorithm; Arabidopsis; Biological Model; Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Genetics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Immunology; Machine Learning; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant; Plant Disease; Plant Immunity; Procedures; Protein Analysis; Protein Database; Statistics And Numerical Data; Algorithms; Arabidopsis Proteins; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Host-pathogen Interactions; Machine Learning; Models, Biological; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Plants; Protein Interaction Mapping","Arabidopsis protein; plant protein; algorithm; Arabidopsis; biological model; biology; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunology; machine learning; metabolism; microbiology; plant; plant disease; plant immunity; procedures; protein analysis; protein database; statistics and numerical data; Algorithms; Arabidopsis Proteins; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Machine Learning; Models, Biological; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Plants; Protein Interaction Mapping",,Arabidopsis Proteins; Plant Proteins,National Natural Science Foundation of China (31471249).,"Savary, Serge, Crop losses due to diseases and their implications for global food production losses and food security, Food Security, 4, 4, pp. 519-537, (2012); Fang, Yi, Current and prospective methods for plant disease detection, Biosensors, 5, 3, pp. 537-561, (2015); Cunha-Cruz, Joana, Genetic structure of populations of the rice-Infecting pathogen rhizoctonia solani AG-1 IA from China, Phytopathology, 99, 9, pp. 1090-1099, (2009); Boyd, Lesley Ann, Plant-pathogen interactions: Disease resistance in modern agriculture, Trends in Genetics, 29, 4, pp. 233-240, (2013); Jones, Jonathan D.G., The plant immune system, Nature, 444, 7117, pp. 323-329, (2006); Dodds, Peter N., Plant immunity: Towards an integrated view of plantĝ€"" pathogen interactions, Nature Reviews Genetics, 11, 8, pp. 539-548, (2010); Ito, Takashi, A comprehensive two-hybrid analysis to explore the yeast protein interactome, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 98, 8, pp. 4569-4574, (2001); Gavin, Anne Claude, Functional organization of the yeast proteome by systematic analysis of protein complexes, Nature, 415, 6868, pp. 141-147, (2002); Guirimand, Thibaut, VirHostNet 2.0: Surfing on the web of virus/host molecular interactions data, Nucleic Acids Research, 43, D1, pp. D583-D587, (2015); Ammari, Mais G., HPIDB 2.0: a curated database for host-pathogen interactions, Database : the journal of biological databases and curation, 2016, (2016)",,Oxford University Press,,,,,,14774054; 14675463,,,29028906,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057310772

If that work of detecting the plant is made automatic, then it would be the essential topic for discovery. Mainly, plant diseases are caused by fungi, bacteria, and virus. All three affect the plant in different way which can be identified. This feature helps in detecting the particular disease. When it comes to fungi, they can be classified with their morphology that is based on their reproductive structures. Bacteria have the unique property of increasing their number in short duration, the single cell dividing into two and hence multiplying in number, but compared to fungi, they have simple life cycle. Viruses are the smallest particle found. They are made up of proteins and genetic materials. The method for detecting involves five stages, in the first stage, the image is selected through the inputs, the second stage involves processing of image, the third involves dividing the image, the fourth involves finding unique attributes, and final step involves analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Automatic Identification; Morphology; Plant Leaf Diseases; Resampling; Segmentation; Symptoms; Automation; Bacteria; Fungi; Image Segmentation; Life Cycle; Morphology; Security Of Data; Viruses; Analysis Of Various; Automatic Identification; Genetic Materials; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Resampling; Short Durations; Symptoms; Data Mining,Automation; Bacteria; Fungi; Image segmentation; Life cycle; Morphology; Security of data; Viruses; Analysis of various; Automatic identification; Genetic materials; Plant disease; Plant leaf; Resampling; Short durations; Symptoms; Data mining,,,,"International Journal of Science and Research, (2015); Thangadurai, K., Computer visionimage enhancement for plant leaves disease detection, pp. 173-175, (2014); IEEE, (2015); Waghmare, Harshal, Detection and classification of diseases of Grape plant using opposite colour Local Binary Pattern feature and machine learning for automated Decision Support System, pp. 513-518, (2016); International Journal of Engineering Studies and Technical Approach, (2016); 2016 Conference on Emerging Devices and Smart Systems Icedss, (2016); Revathi, P., Classification of cotton leaf spot diseases using image processing edge detection techniques, pp. 169-173, (2012); Ratnasari, Evy Kamilah, Sugarcane leaf disease detection and severity estimation based on segmented spots image, pp. 93-98, (2014); Huang, Wenjiang, New optimized spectral indices for identifying and monitoring winter wheat diseases, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 7, 6, pp. 2516-2524, (2014); Husin, Z.

In this review we outline the current methods for the prediction of fungal plant pathogenicity effector proteins. Some fungal effectors have been characterised and are represented by conserved motifs or in sequence repositories, however most fungal effectors do not generally exhibit high conservation of amino acid sequence. Therefore various predictive methods have been developed around: general properties, structure, position in the genomic landscape, and detection of mutations including repeat-induced point mutations and positive selection. A combinatorial approach incorporating several of these methods is often employed and candidates can be prioritised by either ranked scores or hierarchical clustering. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fungal Proteins; Fungal Protein; Virulence Factor; Amino Acid Sequence; Bioinformatics; Conserved Sequence; Genomics; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Plant Pathogen Interaction; Point Mutation; Protein Domain; Protein Secretion; Review; Transcriptomics; Biology; Chemistry; Fungus; Genetics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Metabolism; Microbiology; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Sequence Alignment; Virulence; Computational Biology; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Host-pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Sequence Alignment; Virulence,fungal protein; virulence factor; amino acid sequence; bioinformatics; conserved sequence; genomics; machine learning; nonhuman; plant pathogen interaction; point mutation; protein domain; protein secretion; Review; transcriptomics; biology; chemistry; fungus; genetics; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; plant disease; sequence alignment; virulence; Computational Biology; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Sequence Alignment; Virulence,,Fungal Proteins,The PhD candidature of DABJ was funded by the Centre for Crop and Disease Management and the Curtin Institute for Computation.,"Fisher, Matthew C., Emerging fungal threats to animal, plant and ecosystem health, Nature, 484, 7393, pp. 186-194, (2012); De Wit, Pierre J.G.M., Fungal effector proteins: Past, present and future: Review, Molecular Plant Pathology, 10, 6, pp. 735-747, (2009); Franceschetti, Marina, Effectors of filamentous plant pathogens: Commonalities amid diversity, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 81, 2, (2017); Jiang, Rays H.Y., Mechanisms and evolution of virulence in oomycetes, Annual Review of Phytopathology, 50, pp. 295-318, (2012); Vleeshouwers, Vivianne G.

In this paper, we propose a method of recognition and prediction the nutrient deficiency occurs on fruiting phrase of tomato plant based on the deep neural network. Moreover, we decide to use two essential mineral nutrients (i.e. Calcium and Potassium) for evaluating the nutrient status in the development of tomato plant. Inception-ResNet v2 based-Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is applied to distinguish the above mineral nutrients with the captured images of tomato plant growth under the greenhouse conditions. The aim of this study is to improve the accurate prediction of the nutrient deficiency for increasing the crop production and prevent the emergence of tomato pathology caused by the lack of nutrient.

Differences in the nutrient content significantly affect the photochemical process of photosynthesis therefore playing a crucial role in plants growth and development. In this work, an attempt was made to find a connection between element content in (i) different soils, (ii) plant leaves, grown on these soils and (iii) changes in selected chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, in order to find a method for early detection of plant stress resulting from the combination of nutrient status in natural conditions. To achieve this goal, a mathematical procedure was used which combines principal component analysis (a tool for the reduction of data complexity), hierarchical k-means (a classification method) and a machine-learning method—super-organising maps. Differences in the mineral content of soil and plant leaves resulted in functional changes in the photosynthetic machinery that can be measured by chlorophyll a fluorescent signals. Five groups of patterns in the chlorophyll fluorescent parameters were established: the ‘no deficiency’, Fe-specific deficiency, slight, moderate and strong deficiency. Unfavourable development in groups with nutrient deficiency of any kind was reflected by a strong increase in F<inf>o</inf> and ΔV/Δt<inf>0</inf> and decline in φ<inf>Po</inf>, φ<inf>Eo</inf>δ<inf>Ro</inf> and φ<inf>Ro</inf>. The strong deficiency group showed the suboptimal development of the photosynthetic machinery, which affects both PSII and PSI. The nutrient-deficient groups also differed in antenna complex organisation. Thus, our work suggests that the chlorophyll fluorescent method combined with machine-learning methods can be highly informative and in some cases, it can replace much more expensive and time-consuming procedures such as chemometric analyses. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chlorophyll A Fluorescence; Machine Learning; Nutrient Status; Nutrient-deficiency Detection; Ojip Test; Super-organising Maps; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Soil; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Brassica Rapa; Chemistry; Fluorescence; Food; Photosynthesis; Physiological Stress; Physiology; Plant Leaf; Principal Component Analysis; Soil; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Food; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Principal Component Analysis; Soil; Stress, Physiological","chlorophyll; chlorophyll a; Brassica rapa; chemistry; fluorescence; food; photosynthesis; physiological stress; physiology; plant leaf; principal component analysis; soil; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Food; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Principal Component Analysis; Soil; Stress, Physiological",,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; Chlorophyll; chlorophyll a; Soil","Funding text 1: Author contributions HMK, WB and KG provided the manuscript conception; HMK, KG and WB designed the experiments; KG, UP, KB, KK performed the experiments; KG, UP, KB, KK performed the laboratory analyses; IAS, MDC performed the ChlF measurements; WB, VG performed numerical and statistical analysis of the data; HMK, VG supervised the writing.

Novel methods of cassava disease detection are needed to support improved control which will prevent this crisis. Image recognition offers both a cost effective and scalable technology for disease detection. New deep learning models offer an avenue for this technology to be easily deployed on mobile devices. Using a dataset of cassava disease images taken in the field in Tanzania, we applied transfer learning to train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases and two types of pest damage (or lack thereof). The best trained model accuracies were 98% for brown leaf spot (BLS), 96% for red mite damage (RMD), 95% for green mite damage (GMD), 98% for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), and 96% for cassava mosaic disease (CMD). The best model achieved an overall accuracy of 93% for data not used in the training process.

Plants, in turn, have developed diverse defense mechanisms to identify and evade different pathogenic microorganisms. Early identification of plant disease resistance genes (R genes) can be exploited for crop improvement programs. The present prediction methods are either based on sequence similarity/domain-based methods or electronically annotated sequences, which might miss existing unrecognized proteins or low similarity proteins. Therefore, there is an urgent need to devise a novel machine learning technique to address this problem. In the current study, a SVM-based tool was developed for prediction of disease resistance proteins in plants. All known disease resistance (R) proteins (112) were taken as a positive set, whereas manually curated negative dataset consisted of 119 R proteins. Feature extraction generated 10,270 features using 16 different methods. The ten-fold cross validation was performed to optimize SVM parameters using radial basis function. The model was derived using libSVM and achieved an overall accuracy of 91.11% on the test dataset. The tool was found to be robust and can be used for high-throughput datasets. The current study provides instant identification of R proteins using machine learning approach, in addition to the similarity or domain prediction methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domain Class; Nucleotide Binding Site-leucine Rich Repeat (nbs-lrr); Receptor-like Kinases (rlk); Resistance Proteins; Svm; Plant Proteins; Amino Acids; Artificial Intelligence; Crops; Feature Extraction; Forecasting; Genes; Learning Systems; Microorganisms; Radial Basis Function Networks; Statistical Tests; Crop Improvement Program; Domain Class; Leucine-rich Repeats; Machine Learning Approaches; Machine Learning Techniques; Pathogenic Microorganisms; Plant Disease Resistance Genes; Receptor-like Kinase; Proteins; Disease Resistance Protein; Plant Protein; Unclassified Drug; Accuracy; Amino Acid Composition; Amino Acid Sequence; Area Under The Curve; Article; Bioinformatics; Disease Resistance Plant Protein Predictor; High Throughput Screening; Nonhuman; Plant Disease; Priority Journal; Protein Analysis; Protein Domain; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Support Vector Machine; Biology; Disease Resistance; Genetics; Plant; Procedures; Statistical Model; Computational Biology; Disease Resistance; Models, Statistical; Plant Proteins; Plants; Support Vector Machine","Amino acids; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Genes; Learning systems; Microorganisms; Radial basis function networks; Statistical tests; Crop improvement program; Domain class; Leucine-rich repeats; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Pathogenic microorganisms; Plant disease resistance genes; Receptor-like kinase; Proteins; disease resistance protein; plant protein; unclassified drug; accuracy; amino acid composition; amino acid sequence; area under the curve; Article; bioinformatics; disease resistance plant protein predictor; high throughput screening; nonhuman; plant disease; priority journal; protein analysis; protein domain; receiver operating characteristic; support vector machine; biology; disease resistance; genetics; plant; procedures; statistical model; Computational Biology; Disease Resistance; Models, Statistical; Plant Proteins; Plants; Support Vector Machine",,Plant Proteins,,"Albrecht, Mario, Update on the domain architectures of NLRs and R proteins, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 339, 2, pp. 459-462, (2006); Bendahmane, Abdelhafid I., Constitutive gain-of-function mutants in a nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat protein encoded at the Rx locus of potato, Plant Journal, 32, 2, pp. 195-204, (2002); Bermingham, Mairead L., Application of high-dimensional feature selection: Evaluation for genomic prediction in man, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Chang, Chihchung, LIBSVM: A Library for support vector machines, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, 3, (2011); Chen, Zhongying, The Pseudomonas syringae avrRpt2 gene product promotes pathogen virulence from inside plant cells, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 13, 12, pp. 1312-1321, (2000); Cortes, Corinna, Support-Vector Networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Dangl, Jeffery L., Plant pathogens and integrated defence responses to infection, Nature, 411, 6839, pp. 826-833, (2001); DeYoung, Brody J., Plant NBS-LRR proteins in pathogen sensing and host defense, Nature Immunology, 7, 12, pp. 1243-1249, (2006); Ellis, Jeffrey G., Structure, function and evolution of plant disease resistance genes, Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 3, 4, pp. 278-284, (2000); Guidetti-Gonzalez, Simone, Putative resistance genes in the CitEST database, Genetics and Molecular Biology, 30, 3 SUPPL., pp. 931-942, (2007)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,18790534; 00104825,,CBMDA,27658260,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988369330

In plant hosts, the viral proteins have several basic science implications and biotechnology applications. However in silico identification of these proteins is limited by their high sequence diversity. In this study we developed supervised learning based classification models for plant viral RNA silencing suppressor proteins in plant viruses. We developed four classifiers based on supervised learning algorithms: J48, Random Forest, LibSVM and Naïve Bayes algorithms, with enriched model learning by correlation based feature selection. Structural and physicochemical features calculated for experimentally verified primary protein sequences were used to train the classifiers. The training features include amino acid composition; auto correlation coefficients; composition, transition, and distribution of various physicochemical properties; and pseudo amino acid composition. Performance analysis of predictive models based on 10 fold cross-validation and independent data testing revealed that the Random Forest based model was the best and achieved 86.11% overall accuracy and 86.22% balanced accuracy with a remarkably high area under the Receivers Operating Characteristic curve of 0.95 to predict viral RNA silencing suppressor proteins. The prediction models for plant viral RNA silencing suppressors can potentially aid identification of novel viral RNA silencing suppressors, which will provide valuable insights into the mechanism of RNA silencing and could be further explored as potential targets for designing novel antiviral therapeutics.

A mesophyll colonizer, Xoc differs from X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which invades xylem to cause bacterial blight of rice. Both produce multiple distinct TAL effectors, type III-delivered proteins that transactivate effector-specific host genes. A TAL effector finds its target(s) via a partially degenerate code whereby the modular effector amino acid sequence identifies nucleotide sequences to which the protein binds. Virulence contributions of some Xoo TAL effectors have been shown, and their relevant targets, susceptibility (S) genes, identified, but the role of TAL effectors in leaf streak is uncharacterized. We used host transcript profiling to compare leaf streak to blight and to probe functions of Xoc TAL effectors. We found that Xoc and Xoo induce almost completely different host transcriptional changes. Roughly one in three genes upregulated by the pathogens is preceded by a candidate TAL effector binding element. Experimental analysis of the 44 such genes predicted to be Xoc TAL effector targets verified nearly half, and identified most others as false predictions. None of the Xoc targets is a known bacterial blight S gene. Mutational analysis revealed that Tal2g, which activates two genes, contributes to lesion expansion and bacterial exudation. Use of designer TAL effectors discriminated a sulfate transporter gene as the S gene. Across all targets, basal expression tended to be higher than genome-average, and induction moderate. Finally, machine learning applied to real vs. falsely predicted targets yielded a classifier that recalled 92% of the real targets with 88% precision, providing a tool for better target prediction in the future. Our study expands the number of known TAL effector targets, identifies a new class of S gene, and improves our ability to predict functional targeting. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Transcription Activator Like Effector; Transcription Factor; Unclassified Drug; Article; Bacterial Blight; Bacterial Leaf Streak; Bacterial Virulence; Bacterium Transformation; Controlled Study; Dna Microarray; Dna Polymorphism; Gene Expression; Gene Ontology; Genetic Susceptibility; Hybridization; Mutational Analysis; Nonhuman; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Protein Binding; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Type Iii Secretion System; Upregulation; Xanthomonas Oryzae; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Disease Resistance; Dna Mutational Analysis; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genes, Plant; Host-pathogen Interactions; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oryza Sativa; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Xanthomonas","transcription activator like effector; transcription factor; unclassified drug; article; bacterial blight; bacterial leaf streak; bacterial virulence; bacterium transformation; controlled study; DNA microarray; DNA polymorphism; gene expression; gene ontology; genetic susceptibility; hybridization; mutational analysis; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; protein binding; real time polymerase chain reaction; type III secretion system; upregulation; Xanthomonas oryzae; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Disease Resistance; DNA Mutational Analysis; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genes, Plant; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oryza sativa; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Xanthomonas",,,,"Xanthomonas, (1993); Scientia Agricultura Sinica, (2005); White, Frank F., Host and pathogen factors controlling the Rice-Xanthomonas oryzae interaction, Plant Physiology, 150, 4, pp. 1677-1686, (2009); Niño-Liu, David O., Xanthomonas oryzae pathovars: Model pathogens of a model crop, Molecular Plant Pathology, 7, 5, pp. 303-324, (2006); Swarup, Sanjay, An Xanthomonas citri pathogenicity gene, pthA, pleiotropically encodes gratuitous avirulence on nonhosts., Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 5, 3, pp. 204-213, (1992); Yang, Yinong, Host-specific symptoms and increased release of Xanthomonas citri and X.campestris pv. malvacearum from leaves are determined by the 102-bp tandem repeats of pthA and avrb6, respectively, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 7, 3, pp. 345-355, (1994); Yang, Yinong, Watersoaking function(s) of XcmH1005 are redundantly encoded by members of the Xanthomonas avr/pth gene family, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 9, 2, pp. 105-113, (1996); Yang, Bing, Diverse members of the AvrBs3/PthA family of type III effectors are major virulence determinants in bacterial blight disease of rice, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 17, 11, pp. 1192-1200, (2004); Yang, Bing, Os8N3 is a host disease-susceptibility gene for bacterial blight of rice, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 103, 27, pp. 10503-10508, (2006); Sugio, Akiko, Two type III effector genes of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae control the induction of the host genes OsTFIIAγ1 and OsTFX1 during bacterial blight of rice, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104, 25, pp. 10720-10725, (2007)",,,,,,,,15537374; 15537366,,,24586171,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897731029

Alternaria brassicae causes the disease through the production of host specific toxin viz. chlorotic and necrotic toxins, which are responsible for the formation of chlorotic, necrotic and green islands like disease symptoms in susceptible Brassica leaves. Signal transduction is the means by which cells respond to extracellular information. Mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are important signaling modules in eukaryotic cells. MAPK are important intermediates in signal transduction pathways that are initiated by many types of cell surface receptors. They function Downstream of sensors/receptors and regulate cellular responses to external and endogenous stimuli. Mitogen activated kinase, ensures their specificity of action by interacting with its different substrates through docking domains. Specific docking interactions between MAPKs and its substrate are crucial for efficient and accurate signal transmission. Recent studies have shown that disease resistance against any pathogen in plant is governed by combinatorial interaction between proteins. Therefore, now a day's much effort has gone into finding the complete set of interacting protein. Genome wide protein-protein interaction network have been realized by using high throughput methods like yeast two hybrid system and affinity immunochip based system. Some groups studied the partner of MAPK by using phosphoproteomics approach. However these methods are cost effective, require good infrastructure and contain high false positive result. The need of in silico methods for protein-protein interaction prediction is being driven by above listed limitation and also by the generation of sequences at a rate far beyond our ability to carry out experimental functional analysis. In this chapter we are trying to give insight about different in silico approaches e.g. Machine Learning Approaches viz., Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) etc., Direct Sequence Analysis approach that takes into account surface information for predicting protein-protein interaction, Docking studies which attempts to use geometric and steric considerations to fit two proteins of known structure into a bound complex,(iv) through Phylogenetic profiling. By using some of these methods we studied the MAPK interaction with upstream or downstream proteins viz WRKY protein, Myb protein, bZIP, NAC, MAPKK, Phosphatases and some other defence proteins.
