Deep learning can be a powerful digital tool for on-site, real-time, non-invasive diagnosis of crop nutrient deficiencies. A drone-based RGB image dataset was generated together with ground truthing data in winter wheat (2020) and in winter rye (2021) during tillering and booting in the long-term fertilizer experiment (LTFE) Dikopshof. In this LTFE, the crops were fertilized with the same amounts for decades. The selected treatments included full fertilization including manure (NPKCa+m+s), mineral fertilization (NPKCa), mineral fertilization but no nitrogen (N) application (_PKCa), no phosphorus (P) application (N_KCa), no potassium (K) application (NP_Ca), or no liming (Ca) (NPK_), as well as an unfertilized treatment. The image dataset consisting of more than 3600 UAV-based RGB images was used to train and evaluate in total of eight CNN-based and transformer-based models as baselines within each crop-year and across the two crop-year combinations, aiming to detect the specific fertilizer treatments, including the specific nutrient deficiencies. The field observations showed a strong biomass decline in the case of N omission and no fertilization, though the effects were lower in the case of P, K, and lime omission. The mean detection accuracy within one year was 75% (winter wheat) and 81% (winter rye) across models and treatments. Hereby, the detection accuracy for winter wheat was highest for the NPKCa+m+s (100%) and the unfertilized (96%) treatments as well as the _PKCa treatment (92%), whereas for treatments N_KCa and NPKCa the accuracy was lowest (about 50%). The results were similar for winter rye. In the cross-year and cross-cereal species transfer (training on winter wheat, application on winter rye, and vice versa), the mean accuracy was about 18%. The results highlight the potential of deep learning as a digital tool for decision-making in smart farming but also the difficulties of transferring models across years and crops. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Image Classification; Liming; Nitrogen; Phenotyping; Phosphorous; Potassium; Aircraft Detection; Crops; Deep Learning; Lime; Manures; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Fertilizers; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Potassium; Potassium Fertilizers; Digital Tools; Image Datasets; Images Classification; Liming; Non-invasive Diagnosis; Nutrient Deficiency; Phenotyping; Phosphorous; Rgb Images; Winter Wheat; Image Classification; Data Set; Fertilizer Application; Image Classification; Invasive Species; Liming; Nutrient Loss; Phenotype; Phosphorus; Potassium; Unmanned Vehicle; Wheat; Winter,Aircraft detection; Crops; Deep learning; Lime; Manures; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Potassium; Potassium fertilizers; Digital tools; Image datasets; Images classification; Liming; Non-invasive diagnosis; Nutrient deficiency; Phenotyping; Phosphorous; RGB images; Winter wheat; Image classification; data set; fertilizer application; image classification; invasive species; liming; nutrient loss; phenotype; phosphorus; potassium; unmanned vehicle; wheat; winter,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013985661

Traditional methods for estimating these traits are labor-intensive and limited in scope, while remote sensing technologies and machine learning offer scalable, nondestructive alternatives. This study addresses the challenge of integrating multispectral data and advanced machine learning models, specifically stacked meta-models, to enhance prediction accuracy for yield and protein content in dry peas. Data were collected from 860 genotypes across two North Dakota locations over three growing seasons using uncrewed aerial system-mounted multispectral sensors. The results revealed significant variability in yield and protein content due to location and year, with the meta-model outperforming individual machine learning models for both traits. The meta-model achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 396.28 kg ha−1 and an coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.77 for yield, demonstrating strong predictive performance. However, protein content predictions were moderate, with an RMSE of 1.28% and an R2 of 0.54, highlighting limitations in the correlation between spectral features and protein synthesis. Growth stage analysis emphasized the critical importance of the maturity stages to predict the yield and protein content in dry peas. These findings support the potential of integrating multispectral data and meta-modeling for accurate agricultural predictions. Future research should focus on incorporating additional data sources, refining feature engineering techniques, and tailoring models to specific growth stages to further improve predictive accuracy.

This study characterized a cacao collection (173 accessions) evaluated in Puerto Rico, examining phenotypic diversity, trait interrelationships, and performing comparative analyses with published Trinidad and Colombia datasets. We also developed machine learning (ML) models for yield prediction and identified yield-associated SNP markers. Results: The cacao collection showed significant phenotypic variation and strong intra-collection trait correlations. Comparative analyses revealed conserved trait responses across environments, notably linking susceptibility to black pod rot in Puerto Rico with Witches' Broom Disease in Colombia, suggesting a broad-spectrum disease response mechanism. Machine learning models effectively modeled yield, quantifying a hierarchy of predictor importance, with ‘Total pods’, ‘Infection rate’, and ‘Pod weight’ being the most influential. Integrating existing SNP data for 28 common accessions, multiple SNPs were identified as significantly associated with key horticultural traits, including ‘Total pods’, ‘Infection rate’, and ‘Yield’ (FDR < 0.01). Notably, a single genetic marker on chromosome 5 (TcSNP475), located within a putative zinc finger stress-associated protein gene (Tc05_t008610), was associated with both ‘Total pods’ and ‘Yield’, representing a prime target for marker-assisted selection. Conclusions: This research provides a detailed characterization of a wide germplasm collection, robust yield predictors, and a suite of novel trait-linked genetic markers, offering valuable resources for cacao breeding.

The use of environmentally friendly natural compounds presents a viable alternative to synthetic fungicides for managing postharvest diseases. 3-methyl pentanoic acid (3MP), a short-chain fatty acid widely employed as a flavoring agent and in agrochemicals, has not been explored for its potential in controlling postharvest diseases or its underlying mechanisms of action. Results: This study aimed to evaluate the antifungal activity and elucidate the potential mechanisms of action of 3MP against B. cinerea. Specifically, the effects of 3MP on mycelial growth, spore germination, disease development in tomatoes and strawberries fruit, cell viability, cell membrane integrity, and the expression of key genes (Chs1, Bmp1, Bmp3, and Sak1) associated with cell wall integrity (CWI) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in B. cinerea were investigated. Results showed that mycelial growth, sporulation, spore germination, germ tube elongation, of B. cinerea were significantly suppressed by 3MP in a dose dependent manner. In vivo tests demonstrated that 3MP effectively controlled postharvest grey mold caused by B. cinerea on tomatoes and strawberries at concentrations of 12 μL/L. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) staining assays indicated that 3MP disrupted membrane integrity and impaired cell viability in B. cinerea. Additionally, the expression levels of CWI and MAPK-related genes Chs1, Bmp1, Bmp3 and Sak1 were significantly altered following 3MP treatment. Conclusion: 3MP represents a promising natural alternative to commercial fungicides or a lead compound for developing new biofungicide to control grey mold disease during the postharvest period.

This study introduces an AI-assisted multi-objective optimization approach, where ChatGPT played a central role in optimizing seeding performance by refining disk speed, vacuum pressure, and area of the vacuum hole on the disk. By leveraging ChatGPT for method selection, parameter tuning, and result analysis, the optimization process was streamlined, reducing reliance on traditional trial-and-error approaches and enhancing decision-making efficiency. Two distinct optimization approaches were employed: (i) Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods—MOORA and TOPSIS—to rank existing parameter sets, and (ii) NSGA-II, an evolutionary algorithm that generated new Pareto-optimal solutions by balancing multiple performance criteria. Optimization was conducted based on laboratory experiments using onion and sugar beet seeds, with performance evaluated through quality of feed index (QFI), multiple index (MULTI), miss index (MISS), and preciseness (PREC). ChatGPT, as an advanced AI tool, facilitated method selection, implementation, parameter tuning, and result interpretation. MOORA & TOPSIS provided deterministic optimal parameter combinations, identifying 0.15 m/s disk speed, 1 kPa vacuum pressure, and 3.1 mm² hole area for onion seeds, and 0.2 m/s disk speed, 1.75 kPa vacuum pressure, and 4.7 mm² hole area for sugar beet seeds. In contrast, NSGA-II generated a Pareto-optimal solution set, offering a flexible trade-off between QFI maximization and error minimization. To ensure reliability, NSGA-II results were validated through experimental testing, confirming that the algorithm's predicted optimal settings were within ±5 % of actual measured values. The findings underscore the potential of AI-assisted methodologies, particularly ChatGPT-driven optimization, in agricultural mechanization, enhancing efficiency and reducing dependency on labor-intensive trials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Mechanization; Artificial Intelligence; Chatgpt; Performance Optimisation; Planter,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012256547

Amongst various nutrients, nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K), all together NPK, play the most significant role in gross crop yield. Precise estimation of the fertility status of existing soil NPK is the most significant task for proper fertilizer management. Traditionally, the fertility status of NPK is estimated by chemical analysis, which is expert-dependent and expensive for field applications. Thus, rural farmers apply various fertilizers without estimating the current fertility status of the nutrients, which leads to a nutrient imbalance and a serious threat to sustainable agriculture. Instead, several traditional machine learning models have been suggested for estimating the fertility status of various soil nutrients. However, they have some major limitations with poor performances. Conversely, the stacked ensemble models are more stable and robust compared to base learners with better predictive accuracy. Several successful applications of such models have been reported. However, no stacked ensemble model has been designed for estimating the fertility status of NPK using a trustworthy soil data repository. This paper proposes a novel architecture of a stacked ensemble model for precise estimation of the fertility status of three macronutrients, NPK. The novelty of this work is that the architecture of the existing stacked ensemble models has been restructured by incorporating an additional preprocessing module along with a data feedback technique to boost up the performance. Undoubtedly, a web-based version of such a model will be beneficial for rural farmers and agricultural decision-makers when accessed using smartphones. Our proposed model was experimentally validated using authentic field datasets. Empirical results revealed that our proposed model outperformed all other existing models both in terms of average accuracy (0.8457) and average Cohen’s kappa (0.6114). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fertility Status; Npk; Soil Fertility; Stacked Ensemble Model,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011771840

Integrating multi-omics approaches, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has substantially deepened our understanding of plant–microbe interactions at molecular and system levels. Genomic studies have identified key PGPM traits such as nitrogen fixation, siderophore biosynthesis, and stress-responsive gene clusters. At the same time, transcriptomic profiling has illuminated plant immune priming and hormonal modulation under microbial influence. Proteomics analysis have revealed protein networks underpinning microbial colonization, stress adaptation, and metabolite exchange, with specific markers such as ACC deaminase and antioxidant enzymes linked to growth promotion. Metabolomics further elucidates biochemical pathways shaped by PGPMs, including increased levels of flavonoids, osmoprotectants, and signalling molecules in host plants. The application of omics-guided microbial consortia shows enhanced efficacy compared to single-strain inoculants, promoting greater biomass, yield, and stress resilience. Case studies highlight the successful deployment of PGPMs in ameliorating salinity and drought stress, enhancing phytoremediation, and improving nutrient uptake in diverse crops. Despite these advances, challenges persist, including limited omics resolution in complex soil environments, a lack of standardised data integration pipelines, and ecological variability affecting microbial persistence. Emerging technologies like CRISPR-based genome editing and AI-driven consortia design promise to overcome these barriers by tailoring microbial interventions to crop-specific and environmental contexts.

Moreover, the relationship between the transport efficacy of fluorescence probes in plants and their sizes has been rarely investigated. To address these bottlenecks, we developed an ingenious PEG-engineering strategy on the second near-infrared (NIR-II) donor–acceptor-donor (D-A-D) emissive dye (CCNU1020) to adjust the self-assembly nanosizes of NIR-II fluorescence probes, resulting in three variants: SYH1 (170 nm), SYH2 (80 nm), and SYH3 (60 nm). As the polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain length increased, the probes’ nanosize decreased from 170 to 60 nm. Among them, SYH3 exhibited the fastest entry velocity into Epipremnum Aureum leaf and spread over the leaf veins evenly than the other two probes, of which SYH1 even could hardly entry into the leaf. Meanwhile, SYH3 demonstrated high-contrast imaging of leaf vein with an exceptional signal to background ratio (SBR, ~ 18.6) superior to that of classical NIR-I indocyanine green (ICG) (~ 3.0) and SYH2. This promising imaging ability of leaf veins achieved by size optimization laid the foundation for the early diagnosis of viral infections. In vivo experiments further confirmed that SYH3 effectively accumulated and monitored in the lesion of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-infected Arabidopsis thaliana, which matched well with the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled results. This work represents a significant step forward in plant bioimaging in the cutting-edge NIR-II region. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nir-ii Fluorescence Imaging; Peg-engineering; Plant Bioimaging; Plant Pathogen Diagnosis; Argon; Chlorophyll; Indocyanine Green; Macrogol; Magnesium Sulfate; N,n Dimethylformamide; Petroleum Ether; Potassium Carbonate; Sodium Sulfate; Fluorescent Dyes; Polyethylene Glycols; Applied Biosystems 4700 Maldi Tof Mass Spectrometer; Beijing Hi-tech Optoelectronic; Fluorog 3 Spectrofluorometer; Masslynx Operating System; Plant Diseases; Plant Extracts; Yeast; Bio-imaging; Fluorescence Imaging; Nir-ii Fluorescence Imaging; Pathogen Diagnosis; Plant Bioimaging; Plant Pathogen; Plant Pathogen Diagnose; Polyethylene Glycol-engineering; Signal-to-background Ratio; Tobacco Mosaic Virus; Fluorescence Microscopy; 1 (3 Dimethylamino-propyl)3 Ethylcarbodiimide Hydrochloride; 2 Bromocarbazole; Argon; Chlorophyll; Fluorescent Dye; Green Fluorescent Protein; Indocyanine Green; Macrogol; Magnesium Sulfate; N,n Dimethylformamide; Nanoparticle; Palladium Dichloride; Petroleum Ether; Potassium Carbonate; Sodium Sulfate; Tetrahydrofuran Derivative; Unclassified Drug; Article; Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Controlled Study; Early Diagnosis; Electrospray Mass Spectrometry; Epipremnum Aureum; Fluorescence Imaging; Fluorescence Intensity; High Contrast Plant Imaging; Hydrogen Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Image Analysis; In Vivo Study; Light Scattering; Limit Of Detection; Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption-ionization Mass Spectrometry; Mosaicism; Near Infrared Spectroscopy; Nonhuman; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Particle Size; Photon Correlation Spectroscopy; Plant Leaf; Plant Virus; Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Quantitative Analysis; Signal Noise Ratio; Silica Gel Column Chromatography; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Ultraviolet Spectrophotometry; Virus Infection; Chemistry; Isolation And Purification; Procedures; Virology; Fluorescent Dyes; Optical Imaging; Particle Size; Plant Leaves; Polyethylene Glycols; Tobacco Mosaic Virus","Plant diseases; Plant extracts; Yeast; Bio-imaging; Fluorescence imaging; NIR-II fluorescence imaging; Pathogen diagnosis; Plant bioimaging; Plant pathogen; Plant pathogen diagnose; Polyethylene glycol-engineering; Signal-to-background ratio; Tobacco mosaic virus; Fluorescence microscopy; 1 (3 dimethylamino-propyl)3 ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride; 2 bromocarbazole; argon; chlorophyll; fluorescent dye; green fluorescent protein; indocyanine green; macrogol; magnesium sulfate; n,n dimethylformamide; nanoparticle; palladium dichloride; petroleum ether; potassium carbonate; sodium sulfate; tetrahydrofuran derivative; unclassified drug; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; controlled study; early diagnosis; electrospray mass spectrometry; Epipremnum aureum; fluorescence imaging; fluorescence intensity; high contrast plant imaging; hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance; image analysis; in vivo study; light scattering; limit of detection; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; mosaicism; near infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; particle size; photon correlation spectroscopy; plant leaf; plant virus; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantitative analysis; signal noise ratio; silica gel column chromatography; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; virus infection; chemistry; isolation and purification; procedures; virology; Fluorescent Dyes; Optical Imaging; Particle Size; Plant Leaves; Polyethylene Glycols; Tobacco Mosaic Virus",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007466748

Cassava leaf diseases reduce crop yields, elevate production costs, and disrupt market stability. This places significant burdens on farmers and economies while highlighting the need for effective management strategies. Traditional methods of manual disease diagnosis are costly, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. This research aims to address the challenge of accurate disease classification by overcoming the limitations of existing methods, which encounter difficulties with the complexity and variability of leaf disease symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a novel dual-track feature aggregation architecture that integrates the Residual Inception Positional Encoding Attention (RIPEA) Network with EfficientNet for the classification of cassava leaf diseases. The proposed model employs a dual-track feature aggregation architecture which integrates the RIPEA Network with EfficientNet. The RIPEA track extracts significant features by leveraging residual connections for preserving gradients and uses multi-scale feature fusion for combining fine-grained details with broader patterns. It also incorporates Coordinate and Mixed Attention mechanisms which focus on cross-channel and long-range dependencies. The extracted features from both tracks are aggregated for classification. Furthermore, it incorporates an image augmentation method and a cosine decay learning rate schedule to improve model training. This improves the ability of the model to accurately differentiate between Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Green Mottle (CGM), Mosaic Disease (CMD), and healthy leaves, addressing both local textures and global structures. Additionally, to enhance the interpretability of the model, we apply Grad-CAM to provide visual explanations for the model’s decision-making process, helping to understand which regions of the leaf images contribute to the classification results.

This is particularly important in agriculture as a biocontrol agent of plant diseases. Phage engineering is facilitated by structural knowledge. However, structural information regarding bacteriophages infecting plant pathogens is limited. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of bacteriophage φTE that infects plant pathogen Pectobacterium atrosepticum. The structure reveals a distinct neck topology compared with other myophages, where tail terminator proteins compensate for reduced connectivity between sheath subunits. A contact network between tail fibers, the sheath initiator, and baseplate wedge proteins provides insights into triggers that transduce conformational changes from the baseplate to the sheath to orchestrate contraction. We observe two distinct oligomeric states of the tape measure protein (TMP), which is six-fold in regions proximal to the N-terminus and throughout most of the tail, while three-fold at the C-terminus, indicating that the TMP may be proteolytically cleaved. Our results provide a structural atlas of the model bacteriophage φTE, enhancing future interpretation of phage host interactions in pectobacteria. We anticipate that our structure will inform rational design of biocontrol agents against plant pathogens that cause diseases such as soft rot and blackleg disease in potatoes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna; Viral Tail Proteins; Bacterial Protein; Bacteriophage Dna; Capsid Protein; Dna; Elav Like Protein 2; Monomer; Tape Measure Protein; Unclassified Drug; Virus Tail Protein; Bacteriophage; Bacterium; Biocontrol Agent; Pathogen; Potato; Protein; Agriculture; Agrobacterium Tumefaciens; Alpha Helix; Amino Terminal Sequence; Article; Bacterial Genome; Bacterial Plant Disease; Carboxy Terminal Sequence; Conformational Transition; Controlled Study; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Disulfide Bond; Genome Size; Host Bacterium Interaction; Image Processing; Infectious Agent; Mass Spectrometry; Nonhuman; Oligomerization; Pectobacterium Atrosepticum; Phytopathogen; Protein Folding; Protein Secondary Structure; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; Static Electricity; Stoichiometry; Vibrio Parahaemolyticus; Chemistry; Metabolism; Microbiology; Molecular Model; Myoviridae; Pectobacterium; Plant Disease; Ultrastructure; Virology; Bacteriophages; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Models, Molecular; Plant Diseases; Viral Tail Proteins","bacterial protein; bacteriophage DNA; capsid protein; DNA; ELAV like protein 2; monomer; tape measure protein; unclassified drug; virus tail protein; bacteriophage; bacterium; biocontrol agent; pathogen; potato; protein; agriculture; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; alpha helix; amino terminal sequence; Article; bacterial genome; bacterial plant disease; carboxy terminal sequence; conformational transition; controlled study; cryoelectron microscopy; disulfide bond; genome size; host bacterium interaction; image processing; infectious agent; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; oligomerization; Pectobacterium atrosepticum; phytopathogen; protein folding; protein secondary structure; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; static electricity; stoichiometry; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; chemistry; metabolism; microbiology; molecular model; Myoviridae; Pectobacterium; plant disease; ultrastructure; virology; Bacteriophages; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Models, Molecular; Plant Diseases; Viral Tail Proteins",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002980849

To overcome these complications, Citrus Plant Classification using Gated Fusion Adaptive Graph Neural Network with Harbor Seal Whiskers Optimization Algorithm (CPC-GFAGNN[sbnd]HSWOA) is proposed. Here, the images are taken from Citrus leaf dataset. Afterwards the images are fed into the pre-processing stage. In preprocessing, Unsharp Structure Guided Filtering (USGF) is applied to eliminate noise from the input images. The pre-processed images are given to the Semantic Invariant Multi-view Clustering (SIMVC) for segmenting region of interest from the citrus leaf images. Next, the segmented images are supplied to the feature extraction process. By using Feature Affine Residual Network (FA-ResNet), the features are extracted, like shapes, colors and textures. The extracted features are fed into the Gated Fusion Adaptive Graph Neural Network (GFAGNN) to classify the citrus leaf images as Black Spot, Canker, Greening, Healthy and Melanose. Finally, Harbor Seal Whiskers Optimization Algorithm (HSWOA) is employed to improve the weight parameter of GFAGNN. This combination effectively mitigates issues such as over fitting, class imbalance and suboptimal feature learning, resulting in robust and accurate classification of citrus leaf diseases. The proposed CPC-GFAGNN[sbnd]HSWOA method is implemented and performance is evaluated using metrics. The experimental results shows that the proposed CPC-GFAGNN[sbnd]HSWOA method achieves 18.75 %, 26.89 %, 32.57 % better accuracy, 18.43 %, 25.64 %, 31.40 % better sensitivity when compared with existing AD-CPL-DNN, SA-DNN[sbnd]CDD and CL-DC[sbnd]CNN models respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Feature Affine Residual Network; Gated Fusion Adaptive Graph Neural Network; Harbor Seal Whiskers Optimization Algorithm; Semantic Invariant Multi-view Clustering And Unsharp Structure Guided Filtering; Classification (of Information); Clustering Algorithms; Extraction; Graph Algorithms; Hydraulic Structures; Neural Networks; Optimization; Plants (botany); Textures; Citrus Leaves; Feature Affine Residual Network; Gated Fusion Adaptive Graph Neural Network; Graph Neural Networks; Guided Filtering; Harbor Seal Whisker Optimization Algorithm; Harbor Seals; Multi-view Clustering; Optimization Algorithms; Semantic Invariant Multi-view Clustering And Unsharp Structure Guided Filtering; Semantics,Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Extraction; Graph algorithms; Hydraulic structures; Neural networks; Optimization; Plants (botany); Textures; Citrus leaves; Feature affine residual network; Gated fusion adaptive graph neural network; Graph neural networks; Guided filtering; Harbor seal whisker optimization algorithm; Harbor seals; Multi-view clustering; Optimization algorithms; Semantic invariant multi-view clustering and unsharp structure guided filtering; Semantics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013974827

Addressing the limitations of conventional methods, we propose a multimodal flexible sensing and deep learning-based evaluation framework. The developed flexible optoelectronic in-situ sensing system integrates spectral (410–940 nm, 18 channels) and impedance (100 Hz–10 kHz) detection, allowing conformal attachment to mango surfaces for nondestructive monitoring throughout the growth cycle while collecting spectral, impedance, and physicochemical data. The proposed 1DCNN-ATT-BiLSTM-ATT network employs independent branches to extract local features from each modality, followed by attention mechanisms and temporal modelling for comprehensive feature fusion, achieving 97.5 % accuracy on test sets. Field experiments reveal systematic variations in soluble solid content (SSC), moisture content (MC), and optoelectronic signals during ripening.

Herbicides are commonly used to control invasive weeds such as kochia; however, kochia has developed resistance to multiple herbicide sites of action, creating additional management challenges. Effective detection and identification of herbicide-resistant kochia are therefore critical for site-specific management. In this study, hyperspectral imaging in the visible and near-infrared range was used to acquire spectral data from dicamba-resistant, glyphosate-resistant, glyphosate-susceptible kochia, and sugarbeet. Spectra data were acquired and preprocessed using standard normal variate transformation and Savitzky–Golay smoothing methods, followed by stepwise feature selection to identify wavelengths features for classification. The selected wavelengths were used to train supervised machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost). SVM achieved the highest overall accuracy of 84.7 %, followed by RF, LDA, and XGBoost with accuracy of 81.1 %, 73.6 %, and 62.3 %, respectively. The results highlight the potential of hyperspectral imaging combined with machine learning for precise identification of herbicide-resistant weed for site-specific weed control and help reduce the evolution of resistance species in sugarbeet production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Herbicide-resistant Kochia; Hyperspectral Imaging; Machine Learning; Stepwise Features Selection; Weed Identification,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013783820

However, traditional measurements of these traits across genotypes and environments are labor-intensive and time-consuming, as hundreds or even thousands of plots need to be estimated. A yield trial was carried out using seven sugarcane cultivars planted in a randomized complete block design with four replications for two ratoon crops to estimate sugarcane yield and its components using unoccupied aerial systems (UAS)-based high throughput phenotyping (HTP) and to compare the traditional method with UAS-based yield components in discriminating ability to assess sugarcane yield via a path coefficient analysis. UAS platforms mounted with sensors were flown over the trial. The result shows that UAS-derived plant height (PH) showed a strong relationship with the ground measured PH (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.15 m). Likewise, an accurate millable stalk height (MSH) estimation, using UAS-derived PH as a predictor, was observed (R2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.15 m). Canopy height model (CHM)-derived canopy cover (CC) appeared to be a promising feature to indirectly select or to predict for stalk number (SN) (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 10,975 stalks ha−1). Based on a path coefficient analysis, UAS-based yield components performed equally to or slightly underperformed the traditional method. Traditionally, SN was the largest contributor to cane yield. Similarly, CC and CHM were the important components for UAS-based yield components. Additionally, the yield prediction model using UAS-derived canopy features with five cross validation schemes (CVs) revealed that model accuracy increased as association between predictor variables with a responding variable increased. The present study shows that random forest outperformed (higher r and lower RMSE) the linear regression models (stepwise, lasso, and ridge) in all CVs. The linear regressions were off when they were used to predict the performance of cultivars in untested crop/environments (CVs2 and CVs5), while a higher accuracy was observed when using random forest in those CVs. More importantly, the accuracy of all models reduced when they were tested in untested crop/environments (CVs2 and CVs5), indicating the challenge of using a prediction model applied to new environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Machine Learning; Path Coefficient Analysis; Sensors; Yield Prediction; Antennas; Forecasting; Learning Systems; Linear Regression; Molasses; Plants (botany); Random Forests; Sugar Cane; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Aerial Systems; Canopy Height Models; Cross Validation; High-throughput Phenotyping; Machine-learning; Path Coefficient Analysis; Plant Height; Sugarcane Yield; Yield Components; Yield Prediction; Crops; Accuracy Assessment; Aerial Survey; Canopy Architecture; Crop Yield; Cultivar; Ecological Modeling; Estimation Method; Genotype; Machine Learning; Model Validation; Path Analysis; Plant Breeding; Sensor; Sugar Cane,Antennas; Forecasting; Learning systems; Linear regression; Molasses; Plants (botany); Random forests; Sugar cane; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial systems; Canopy Height Models; Cross validation; High-throughput phenotyping; Machine-learning; Path coefficient analysis; Plant height; Sugarcane yield; Yield components; Yield prediction; Crops; accuracy assessment; aerial survey; canopy architecture; crop yield; cultivar; ecological modeling; estimation method; genotype; machine learning; model validation; path analysis; plant breeding; sensor; sugar cane,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008008533

Early diagnosis and detection are mandatory for the timely intervention and yield preservation. This will ensure the optimal yield of the crop and its quality. Hence in this approach a real-time hybrid approach BADAM is proposed for the detection and classification of the sugarcane leaf diseases. The hybrid approach BADAM consists of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network combined with the Adam optimizer. For training the model both disease-affected leaves and the nonaffected leaves are considered and initially subjected to preprocessing model for enhancing the feature extraction process. The BiLSTM model is designed to capture both temporal and spatial dependencies within the image sequences, effectively addressing the challenges posed by varying leaf conditions and environmental factors. The Adam optimizer is employed to improve convergence rates and enhance model performance through adaptive learning rates. The model's performance is evaluated using the metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score and precision by demonstrating significant improvements over traditional classification methods. The experimentation results indicate that the proposed approach provides better accuracy by facilitating the real-time disease detection by making it comfortable by providing a valuable tool for farmers and agricultural practitioners. The implications of this work extend to the development of smart agricultural systems that leverage deep learning technologies for sustainable farming practices.

However, unfortunately, due to various diseases, huge agricultural yields of sugarcane are lost every year. This amount can be easily saved if a farmer can identify the diseases in their early stage. For this purpose, numerous models have been proposed in recent years. However, these models cannot produce acceptable impacts in real-world applications due to background noise, environmental factors, and resource constraints. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi Level Transformer Based Sugarcane Disease Classifier (MLTSDC) model to solve this problem. The proposed MLTSDC model utilizes two levels of classification. The first level identifies the presence or absence of abnormal features, while the second maps them to their diseases. This enables the model to learn and identify the key features of diseases. Moreover, the MLTSDC model also incorporates the transformer's self-attention mechanism to minimize the effect of background noise. Experiments conducted on publicly available datasets reveal that the proposed MLTSDC model works better than other existing models.

Cassava is a rich plant in protein and vitamins, particularly in the leaves, and it is also employed as a substitute for rice. Since, the leaf is the most susceptible portion of a plant, it is said to be affected easily in comparison with the other parts. Therefore, the detection of plant leaf diseases may decrease the possibility that the plant will undergo additional damage. Many research works have been designed for Cassava plant leaf disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of leaf disease detection was not improved with the minimum amount of error and time. In this paper, a novel technique called Gaussian Regressed Generative Adversarial Networks based Hermitian Extreme Gradient Boosting (GRGAN-HEGB) is introduced for accurate cassava plant disease detection. The GRGAN-HEGB technique is composed of three parts: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. At first, the numbers of real cassava leaf images are collected from the Cassava Disease Classification dataset. Then, the collected cassava leaf images are preprocessed using the Gaussian Process Regressed Generative Adversarial Network (GPR-GAN) model. Feature extraction is performed by employing Continuous Hermitian Contingency Correlation (CH-CC) model to extract the most influential features such as texture, shape, and colour for disease pattern detection. Lastly, the Cophenetic Optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting classification process is performed to classify the input cassava leaf images with extracted features. As a result, the accuracy of leaf disease detection is improved with a short processing time. Experimental evaluation is carried out using the cassava disease classification dataset by considering different metrics such as disease detection accuracy, disease detection time, precision, and recall. The statistical results confirm that the proposed technique achieves higher accuracy by 12 %, precision by 2 %, and recall by 2 % with minimum disease detection processing time by 10 % than the conventional classification methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cassava Plant Leaf Disease Diagnosis; Continuous Hermitian Contingency Correlation; Cophenetic Optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting; Gaussian Process Regressed Generative Adversarial Networks; Plant Leaves; Adversarial Networks; Cassavum Plant Leaf Disease Diagnose; Continuous Hermitian Contingency Correlation; Cophenetic Optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting; Disease Diagnosis; Gaussian Process Regressed Generative Adversarial Network; Gaussian Processes; Gradient Boosting; Hermitians; Leaf Disease; Plant Leaves; Article; Cassava; Color; Controlled Study; Disease Classification; Feature Extraction; Generative Adversarial Network; Image Processing; Measurement Accuracy; Nonhuman; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Texture Analysis; Time,Adversarial networks; Cassavum plant leaf disease diagnose; Continuous hermitian contingency correlation; Cophenetic optimized extreme gradient boosting; Disease diagnosis; Gaussian process regressed generative adversarial network; Gaussian Processes; Gradient boosting; Hermitians; Leaf disease; Plant leaves; Article; cassava; color; controlled study; disease classification; feature extraction; generative adversarial network; image processing; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; plant disease; plant leaf; texture analysis; time,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000145242

However, there occurs a varied range of problems in irrigation system like issues in crop monitoring, water level monitoring and so on. some significant factors like soil temperature, air quality real-time observation, appropriate time for delivering crops to market, water level observation and so on are sensed and are estimated with the use of IoT components for enhancing the productivity. A precise system for crop recommendation is a modern farming approach which uses research data regarding characteristics of soil, types of soil collection of crop yield data, and the suggestion to farmers to choose right crop at right time period depending on their site-desired parameters. Thus, a wrong choice of crop problem is eradicated and the productivity is enhanced. In this paper, sensor-based crop monitoring is performed which helps the farmer to yield right crop at the right time and aims at developing a smart-farming technology. Initially, the database is collected by rope wire that consists of sensors connected to micro controller and the data attained from sensor are stored in cloud at transmitter side from which the data is monitored and processed for further decision making. At receiver side, the collected data is preprocessed. The features are extracted with the use of Discrete Randomized Non-separable Shearlet Transform based feature extraction approach (DRNS-STFE). The best optimum features were selected with the utilization of Reiterative search-based wrapper subset selection (RSB-WSS). The optimization process was carried with the help of multi-objective gradient fast convergence swarm optimization (MOG-FCSOA) for attaining optimal features. At last, the classifier is employed for the classification of sensed data with the use of Consecutive deep ImageNet classifier (CD-ImageNet) classification process.

The CSM-CERES-Maize model (DSSAT) was adapted to simulate forage maize yields by calibrating the genetic parameters of six cultivars: SE1–200, SE2–300 and SE3–400 in three sites and three years in Asturias, and XU1–220, XU2–300 and XU3–400 in four sites and three years in Galicia. Calibration using the CSM-CERES-Maize model, together with the use of historical meteorological data (2000–2022) from the study sites, enabled simulation of forage maize yield (whole plant dry matter yield) and quality (whole plant net energy for lactation yield and whole plant crude protein yield) for six cultivars during the 23-year period. LightGBM models (a machine learning technique) were used with the simulated forage maize yield, quality data, historical weather, soil, and management data to capture non-linear relationships in the data and to identify the most influential variables for crop yield and quality predictions. The results of the model evaluation yielded an accuracy of 94.7%, (R2 score = 0.86) for forage maize yield, an accuracy of 94.0% (R2 score = 0.84) for the net energy for lactation yield and an accuracy of 93.0% (R2 score = 0.85) for the crude protein yield. Variable importance plots revealed Growing Season and Radiation from sowing to harvest to be the top two most influential predictor variables. In Asturias and Galicia, the cultivars with the longest cycle (cultivars cycle 400) are those with the highest values for the variables studied in the 23 years of historical meteorological data (average of three sites in Asturias and four sites in Galicia with three sowing dates in each site). The models will be available to make predictions for forage maize yield and quality by non-specialist users, using the geographical location of the crop field, cultivar type, sowing and harvest date and probable values of weather variables during the growing season as input data. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Calibration; Crop Management; Cultivar; Forage; Genetic Parameters; Growing Season; Harvest; Lactation; Machine Learning; Maize; Nonhuman; Pharmaceutics; Prediction; Predictor Variable; Simulation; Sowing; Sowing Date; Spain; Weather; Crop; Growth, Development And Aging; Crops, Agricultural; Machine Learning; Zea Mays","article; calibration; crop management; cultivar; forage; genetic parameters; growing season; harvest; lactation; machine learning; maize; nonhuman; pharmaceutics; prediction; predictor variable; simulation; sowing; sowing date; Spain; weather; crop; growth, development and aging; Crops, Agricultural; Machine Learning; Zea mays",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013416732

UAV hyperspectral technology can estimate plant nitrogen content non-destructively and efficiently, which is significant for the timely control of tree growth and precise management. Flight height directly affects the accuracy and efficiency of plant information acquisition. In this study, UAV remote sensing images of different resolutions were acquired during the flowering stage of Carya illinoinensis (Changlin and Jiande series) by setting three flight heights (i. e., 40, 60, and 80 m). Thus, the canopy spectra of Carya illinoinensis at the corresponding heights were obtained. Raw hyperspectral data were preprocessed using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Furthermore, the response relationship between the LNC of Carya illinoinensis and the canopy spectrum was analyzed by combining two-band spectral indices (i. e., normalized difference spectral index, NDSI). Finally, the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling-iteratively retaining informative variables (CARS-IRIV) algorithm was used to screen the feature variables. Back propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) algorithms were used to construct spectral response estimation models for Carya illinoinensis LNC at different heights, to reveal the impact mechanism of UAV flight heights on the canopy spectral characteristics of Carya illinoinensis and LNC. Results showed improved correlation between the canopy spectrum after CWT pretreatment and Carya illinoinensis LNC. CWT combined with NDSI performed better in improving the correlation with LNC. As the flight height increased (from 40, 60 to 80 m), the correlation with the LNC increases for both single-band and two-band spectra. The optimal LNC estimation model was CWT-scale 3-NDSI-BPNN at 40 m flight height, R° = 0.73, RMSEP= 1.13 g · kg-1, and RPD= 1.97. The research results can provide technical support for improving the accuracy of remote sensing estimation of Carya illinoinensis LNC, and further provide a reference for researchers to use a UAV equipped with sensing devices to obtain crop information and set appropriate flight heights. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carya Illinoensis; Flight Heights; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; Uav Hyperspectral Technology; Wavelet Transform; Amino Acids; Decision Trees; Iterative Methods; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Plant Diseases; Plants (botany); Random Forests; Remote Sensing; Spectrum Analysis; Technology Transfer; Canopy Spectrum; Carya Illinoensis; Carya Illinoinensis; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Flight Height; Hyperspectral; Machine-learning; Nitrogen Content; Uav Hyperspectral Technology; Wavelets Transform; Nitrogen; Wavelet Transforms,Amino acids; Decision trees; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Machine learning; Plant diseases; Plants (botany); Random forests; Remote sensing; Spectrum analysis; Technology transfer; Canopy spectrum; Carya illinoensis; Carya illinoinensis; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Flight height; HyperSpectral; Machine-learning; Nitrogen content; UAV hyperspectral technology; Wavelets transform; Nitrogen; Wavelet transforms,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012513573

Despite its significant impact on citrus agricultural production, the molecular mechanisms underlying kitavirus infections remain largely unknown. Here, we engineered a recombinant citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C, genus Cilevirus) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and demonstrated its feasibility in studying the biology of cilevirus. Genetic manipulation of rCiLV-C-GFP revealed that vRNA1 is essential for replication and can self-replicate independently, while vRNA2 is crucial for movement. The intergenic region between the polymerase and capsid protein (CP) acts as a promoter for CP gene expression. Frame-shift and deletion analyses provided key insights into replication, movement, and morphogenesis. We reported that CP is critical for viral RNA accumulation, while movement protein (p32) facilitates viral spread. The putative glycoprotein (p61) is not structurally essential, as its deletion did not affect virion assembly, whereas the putative matrix protein (p24) is critical for morphogenesis, likely acting as a structural protein. Deletion of the RNA silencing suppressor (RSS, p15) and p15-p61 attenuated symptoms, implicating them as virulence factors. Additional analyses revealed that CP enhances vRNA accumulation through a mechanism independent of RSS. CP exhibits RNA-binding properties and interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), suggesting a role in translation. Overexpression of eIF4A increased CiLV-C RNA accumulation, while eIF4A knockdown reduced it, indicating that CP may recruit eIF4A to promote replication. Similar results were observed with turnip crinkle virus (TCV), and notably, the TCV CP efficiently restored RNA accumulation of a CP-defective CiLV-C, suggesting the existence of a conserved, CP-dependent, replication-related mechanism shared across distinct virus families. Our findings support the proposal of an initial model that elucidates the mechanism through which the CPs drive the production of high levels of vRNA manipulating host eIFs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dna Polymerase; Capsid Proteins; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4a; Lsm 780 Axiobserver; Quantstudio 3; Revertaid H; Capsid Protein; Dna Polymerase; Initiation Factor 4a; Liquid Nitrogen; Messenger Rna; Virus Rna; Agrobacterium Tumefaciens; Article; Assay; Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation Assay; Bioassay; Coimmunoprecipitation; Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy; Cucumber Mosaic Virus; Darkness; Electroporation; Fluorescence; Gene; Gene Expression; Genetic Manipulation; Image Processing; Kitavirus; L23 Gene; Light; Mass Spectrometry; Mrna Expression Level; Nicotiana Benthamiana; Nonhuman; Northern Blotting; Optical Density; P29 Gene; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Plant Virus; Plasmid; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Expression; Protein Protein Interaction; Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reproducibility; Rna Extraction; Virus Infection; Virus Replication; Citrus; Genetics; Metabolism; Physiology; Plant Disease; Virology; Capsid Proteins; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4a; Plant Diseases; Plant Viruses; Virus Replication,capsid protein; DNA polymerase; initiation factor 4A; liquid nitrogen; messenger RNA; virus RNA; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Article; assay; Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay; bioassay; coimmunoprecipitation; confocal laser scanning microscopy; Cucumber mosaic virus; darkness; electroporation; fluorescence; gene; gene expression; genetic manipulation; image processing; kitavirus; L23 gene; light; mass spectrometry; mRNA expression level; Nicotiana benthamiana; nonhuman; Northern blotting; optical density; p29 gene; plant growth; plant leaf; plant virus; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; protein expression; protein protein interaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reproducibility; RNA extraction; virus infection; virus replication; Citrus; genetics; metabolism; physiology; plant disease; virology; Capsid Proteins; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A; Plant Diseases; Plant Viruses; Virus Replication,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012222412

Abstract: Plant breeding has traditionally relied on phenotyping to select individuals with desirable traits—a process that is both costly and time-consuming. Increasingly, breeding strategies are shifting toward precision breeding, where causal variants are directly targeted based on their effects. To predict the effects of causal variants, in silico methods are emerging as efficient alternatives or complements to mutagenesis screens. Here, we review state-of-the-art machine learning methods for predicting variant effects in plants across both coding and noncoding regions, contrasting supervised approaches in functional genomics with unsupervised methods in comparative genomics. We discuss challenges in validating predictions, and compare these methods with traditional association and comparative genomics techniques. We argue that modern sequence models extend traditional methods by generalizing across genomic contexts, fitting a unified model across loci rather than a separate model for each locus. In doing so, they address inherent limitations of traditional quantitative and evolutionary comparative genetics techniques. However, the accuracy and generalizability of sequence models heavily depend on the training data, highlighting the need for validation experiments. We point to successful applications of sequence models, especially with protein sequences, and identify areas for further improvement, especially in modeling regulatory sequences. While not yet mature for in silico-driven precision breeding, sequence models show strong potential to become an integral part of the breeder’s toolbox. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genes; Learning Systems; Molecular Biology; Personnel Training; Plant Diseases; Plants (botany); Prediction Models; Comparative Genomics; High Resolution; In-silico; Key Message; Message Sequences; Plant Breeding; Rigorous Validation; Sequence Models; Silico Prediction; Validation Study; Forecasting; Biological Model; Computer Simulation; Genetic Variation; Genetics; Genomics; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plant; Plant Breeding; Plant Genome; Procedures; Computer Simulation; Genetic Variation; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Machine Learning; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plants","Genes; Learning systems; Molecular biology; Personnel training; Plant diseases; Plants (botany); Prediction models; Comparative genomics; High resolution; In-silico; Key message; Message sequences; Plant breeding; Rigorous validation; Sequence models; Silico prediction; Validation study; Forecasting; biological model; computer simulation; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; machine learning; phenotype; plant; plant breeding; plant genome; procedures; Computer Simulation; Genetic Variation; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Machine Learning; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plants",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011994604

Although recent advances have explored deep learning for fruit classification, there remains a need for comprehensive, objective, and scalable solutions that can reliably assess both maturity and quality under real-world farming conditions. To address this gap, this study systematically evaluates a suite of advanced deep learning models, including Vision Transformer (ViT), VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, Xception, and InceptionV3, on a diverse, field-collected image dataset of dragon fruits, applying robust preprocessing, augmentation, and transfer learning techniques to enhance model generalizability. Our results show that the ViT model achieved the highest performance for quality grading, with an accuracy of 96.45% and strong precision, recall, and F1-score, making it highly effective in distinguishing between fresh and defective fruits. For maturity detection, the VGG16 model, optimized with early stopping, attained an accuracy of 95.58%, with a precision of 0.95, and a recall of 0.9633, outperforming the other tested models in classifying fruits as mature or immature. These findings provide new benchmarks for automated dragon fruit grading, demonstrating the potential of deep learning to overcome the limitations of manual assessment by providing rapid, consistent, and accurate classification. Furthermore, the present work can be intensified through the development of a mobile application for in-field use, expansion of the system to other crops, and integration with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to refine predictions based on environmental factors, which would significantly improve crop quality and streamline the farming process, reduce waste, and optimize harvest timing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dragon Fruit Disease Detection; Efficientnet; Ensemble Model; Inceptionv3; Machine Learning; Maturity Classification; Resnet50; Vgg16; Vision Transformer (vit); Xception; Xgboost,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010653955

The proposed framework comprises two core modules: (i) Crop Recommendation and (ii) Pest Detection. The Crop Recommendation module utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on transfer learning to process agronomic inputs such as macronutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), soil pH, and climatic parameters (Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall). This model is optimized with a learning rate of 0.0001, batch size of 16, and trained over 100 epochs. Following crop recommendation, the pest detection and recommendation module is executed using the IP102 dataset to ensure targeted pest identification and treatment. The Pest Detection module leverages EfficientNet B4, employing a learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 64, and trained for 11 epochs with ReLU and Softmax activations, a dropout rate of 0.4, and weight decay of 0.005. It processes high-resolution images (1024 × 1024 pixels) of rice crops annotated with disease types and severity to detect pest species and recommend targeted pesticide interventions. The system achieved a training accuracy of 96.32% and testing accuracy of 82.54% with EfficientNet B4.

However, little research has addressed the impact of biotic and abiotic stressors on phloem structure and development. This study extends recent interest on stress impact on phloem to further understand its physiological limits by exploring a common combination of stressors within forest systems: reduced light availability and concomitant foliar pathogenic infection. We compared juvenile Pinus radiata D. Don. plants growing under optimal light conditions to plants growing under reduced light availability and exposure to pathogenic infection. We monitored foliar gas exchange and took destructive samples for nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) analysis and phloem anatomy in spring and early summer. We used software-assisted image analysis to determine cell composition and area of conducting phloem, and a fluid dynamics model to derive phloem hydraulic parameters. Phloem showed environmental plasticity within the same growing season. We found changes in phloem anatomy in shaded and infected plants, including an increased sieve cell density and permeability, and reduced cell wall thickness. While intrinsic phloem hydraulic efficiency was maintained at the tissue level in stressed plants, the reduction in phloem cross-sectional area resulted in an eventual decline in phloem sap flow rate. Thus, phloem cross-sectional area was dynamically adjusted to match reduced translocation requirements. In addition, shaded and infected plants experienced reduced growth and C assimilation, as well as greater necrotic photosynthetic tissue, but showed similar levels of total NSC than control plants. The high levels of NSC observed in our stressed plants are an important finding that suggests that radial growth cessation and, by association, phloem formation impairment are induced by sink limitation instead of reduced carbohydrate supply to the meristem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Conifer; Environmental Plasticity; Foliar Disease; Light Availability; Monterrey Pine; Nonstructural Carbohydrates; Permeability; Phloem Transport; Sieve Cells; Sink Limitation; Anatomy; Carbohydrate; Cell Component; Gas Exchange; Growth Rate; Image Analysis; Light Availability; Phloem; Light; Microbiology; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Pine; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Radiation Response; Light; Phloem; Photosynthesis; Pinus; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves,anatomy; carbohydrate; cell component; gas exchange; growth rate; image analysis; light availability; phloem; light; microbiology; photosynthesis; physiology; pine; plant disease; plant leaf; radiation response; Light; Phloem; Photosynthesis; Pinus; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005097562

Identifying PPIs in plant-pathogen interactions is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant defense and pathogen virulence. However, experimental methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, prompting the use of computational techniques to complement traditional approaches. A robust ensemble model was developed using multiple sequence encodings and diverse learning algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network. The features used included auto-covariance, conjoint triad, and local descriptor schemes, which were selected based on their performance. The top three performing models were combined into an ensemble model, improving prediction accuracy to approximately 97%. The PlantPathoPPI tool, developed through this approach, was compared with existing tools using an independent test dataset, showing promising potential for PPI prediction in plant-pathogen interactions. To facilitate broad accessibility, a web-based prediction server was developed, available at https://plantpathoppi.onrender.com/, alongside a Python package on https://pypi.org/project/plantpathoppi-ml/.

UAV hyperspectral images, RGB images, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data were collected at different growth stages, and a comprehensive set of spectral, structural, and textural features reflecting the sugar beet canopy were extracted. Three machine learning algorithms, including multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were used to construct prediction models for nitrogen accumulation and sugar yield. The results showed the following. LiDAR features and textural features that characterize the canopy structure of sugar beet are essential for reflecting nitrogen accumulation, and LiDAR features play a key role in sugar yield prediction. For nitrogen accumulation prediction, the MLR model performed best during the rapid foliage growth period (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.44). For sugar yield prediction, the MLR model, when combined with multi-temporal data, achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.16), which was 21% higher than the best single-phase prediction result (sugar accumulation stage). The collaborative use of multisource remote sensing data significantly improved accuracy compared to single data sources, with nitrogen estimation accuracy increasing by 55% and sugar yield estimation accuracy increasing by 28%. These findings indicate that multisource remote sensing data can be used to diagnose nitrogen nutrition and predict sugar yield in sugar beet. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Multi-temporal; Multisource Remote Sensing Data; Predictive Modeling; Sugar Beet; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000380666

This research undertakes a general methodology for detecting diseases of sugarcane leaf using high-dimensional advanced machine learning techniques and image processing methodologies. The methodology applies convolutional neural network (CNNs), Random Forests (RF), and support vector machine (SVMs) in the classification and differentiation between the images of healthy and diseased sugarcane leaves. A total of approximately 13,842 images are collected within a dataset that contains several symptoms related to diseases on the crop including red rot, bacterial blight, and yellow leaf disease. Rigorous image preprocessing methods are inducted into methodology for better model performance. Hyperparameter tuning is then carried on each of the machine learning models to optimize learning rate, batch size, and number of trees to fine-tune the models to output high accuracies in classification. It can thus be seen that CNN performs better compared to the RF and SVM models since accuracies of the CNN model are above 95%. Additionally, the integration of mobile applications with real-time technologies in disease detection makes it possible for users to upload pictures, which would result in instant feedback on the health of their plants regarding early interventions that may be undertaken. The evaluation metrics for this performance include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, all of which confirm the performance of the method under review. This project therefore shows the possibility of using technologies in machine learning and image processing for the implementation and development of a new framework of sugarcane farming concerning diseases' management, eventually bringing about increased productivity in agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Intelligence; Attention Mechanism; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Health Monitoring; Data Augmentation; Deep Learning; Disease Classification; Environmental Adaptation Method; Feature Extraction; Hyperparameter Tuning; Image Processing; Leaf Diseases; Machine Learning; Mobile Application For Agriculture; Precision Agriculture; Random Forests; Real-time Detection; Sugarcane; Support Vector Machine Texture Analysis; Agricultural Machinery; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Deep Learning; Forestry; Image Classification; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Molasses; Plants (botany); Precision Agriculture; Predictive Analytics; Sugar Cane; Support Vector Machines; Adaptation Methods; Agricultural Intelligence; Attention Mechanisms; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Health Monitoring; Data Augmentation; Disease Classification; Environmental Adaptation; Environmental Adaptation Method; Features Extraction; Health Monitoring; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter Tuning; Images Processing; Leaf Disease; Machine-learning; Mobile Application For Agriculture; Mobile Applications; Precision Agriculture; Random Forests; Real-time Detection; Sugarcane; Support Vector Machine Texture Analyze; Support Vectors Machine; Texture Analysis; Feature Extraction,Agricultural machinery; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Forestry; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Molasses; Plants (botany); Precision agriculture; Predictive analytics; Sugar cane; Support vector machines; Adaptation methods; Agricultural intelligence; Attention mechanisms; Convolutional neural network; Crop health monitoring; Data augmentation; Disease classification; Environmental adaptation; Environmental adaptation method; Features extraction; Health monitoring; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter tuning; Images processing; Leaf disease; Machine-learning; Mobile application for agriculture; Mobile applications; Precision Agriculture; Random forests; Real-time detection; Sugarcane; Support vector machine texture analyze; Support vectors machine; Texture analysis; Feature extraction,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010778556

Plants are highly sensitive to temperature changes beyond their optimal growth range. Developing thermotolerant cultivars that can endure high temperatures without compromising yield or agronomic traits is considered the most sustainable way to feed the growing global population in a warming world. However, breeding for thermotolerance is complex due to its polygenic nature and the intricate genetic regulatory networks involved. Gene-editing technologies, especially clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), have been instrumental in creating new thermotolerant plant varieties and understanding their functions. In plant breeding, the common gene-editing method involves targeted mutations in protein-coding genes to generate phenotypic diversity for selection. These mutations often result in gene knockouts, gain-of-function, or neofunctionalization. A new approach in genome editing for crop improvement focuses on noncoding DNA, particularly cis-regulatory elements (CREs), which regulate gene expression through interactions with trans-regulatory elements. Identifying the right noncoding DNA targets for gene editing remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence and machine learning can help analyze genomics, transcriptomics, and phenomics data to find suitable regions for modification.

To model the quantitative genetic architecture of a generalist pathogen with an extensive host range, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the lesion area of Botrytis cinerea across 8 hosts. This revealed that it was possible to partition the virulence, as defined by the lesion area, common across all hosts from host-specific virulence. All traits showed that a large proportion of the Botrytis genome likely contributes to fungal lesion development on leaves with small effect sizes. The candidate genes are evenly spread across the core chromosomes with no indication of bipartite genomic architecture. The GWAS-identified polymorphisms and genes show that B. cinerea relies on genetic variants across hundreds of genes for growing on diverse hosts, with most genes influencing relatively few hosts. When pathogen genes were associated with multiple hosts, they were associated with unrelated rather than related host species. Comparative genomics further suggested that the GWAS-identified genes are largely syntenic with other specialist Botrytis species and not unique to B. cinerea. Overall, as shown in Arabidopsis thaliana, B. cinerea’s generalist behavior is derived from the sum of the genome-wide genetic variation acting within gene networks that differentially coordinate the interaction with diverse hosts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Botrytis Cinerea; Crops; Fungal Virulence; Fungi; Generalist Pathogen; Gwas; Host Range; Host–pathogen Interaction; Quantitative Genetics; Spacer Dna; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Article; Botrytis Cinerea; Chromosome; Comparative Genomics; Controlled Study; Eudicot; Fungal Strain; Fungal Virulence; Gene; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Network; Genetic Variability; Genetic Variation; Genome; Genome-wide Association Study; Genotype; Host Pathogen Interaction; Host Range; Image Analysis; Nonhuman; Phylogenetic Tree; Phylogeny; Plant Leaf; Plant Pathogen Interaction; Protein Domain; Quantitative Genetics; Botrytis; Fungal Genome; Genetics; Microbiology; Multifactorial Inheritance; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Virulence; Genome, Fungal; Genome-wide Association Study; Host Specificity; Host-pathogen Interactions; Multifactorial Inheritance; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Virulence","spacer DNA; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; Botrytis cinerea; chromosome; comparative genomics; controlled study; eudicot; fungal strain; fungal virulence; gene; gene ontology; gene regulatory network; genetic variability; genetic variation; genome; genome-wide association study; genotype; host pathogen interaction; host range; image analysis; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; plant leaf; plant pathogen interaction; protein domain; quantitative genetics; Botrytis; fungal genome; genetics; microbiology; multifactorial inheritance; pathogenicity; plant disease; single nucleotide polymorphism; virulence; Genome, Fungal; Genome-Wide Association Study; Host Specificity; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Multifactorial Inheritance; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Virulence",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010945657

Spinach, abundant in iron, vitamins, and other essential nutrients, plays a vital role in maintaining the health of human tissues, cartilage, and hair. However, extreme summer heat and plant diseases can significantly reduce spinach yields, making it less nutritious and harder to obtain. Implementing improved detection and classification of bacterial and fungal diseases affecting spinach leaves is crucial for minimizing pesticide use and enhancing agricultural output. A cutting-edge approach was introduced for identifying diseases in spinach leaves through deep learning object detection. To tackle these issues, the DenseNet-121-DO model served as the basis for developing the Custom Monochromatic LeafAdaptNet (MLAN).

Abstract: Grain legumes, such as soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) play an important role in combating micronutrient malnutrition in the growing human population. However, plant diseases significantly reduce grain yield, causing 10–40% losses in major food crops. The genetic mechanisms associated with disease resistance in legumes have been widely studied using genomic approaches. Multi-omics data encompassing various biological layers such as the transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, and metabolome, in addition to the genome, enables researchers to gain a deeper understanding of these complementary layers and their roles in complex legume-pathogen interactions. Genomic prediction, used to select the best genotypes with desirable traits for breeding, has largely relied on genome-wide markers and statistical approaches to estimate the breeding values of individuals. Integrating multi-omics data into genomic prediction can be achieved using machine learning models, which can capture nonlinear relationships prevalent in high-dimensional data better than traditional statistical methods. This integration may enable more accurate predictions and identification of resistance mechanisms for breeding resistant legumes. Despite its potential, multi-omics integration for disease resistance prediction in legumes has been largely unexplored. In this review, we explore omics studies focusing on disease resistance in legumes and discuss how machine learning models can integrate multi-omics data for disease resistance prediction. Such multi-omics assisted prediction has the potential to reduce the breeding cycle for developing disease-resistant legume varieties. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crops; Cultivation; Diseases; Genes; Integration; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Plant Diseases; Plants (botany); Statistical Methods; 'omics'; Chickpea (cicer Arietinum L.); Disease Resistance; Genomic Predictions; Grain Legume; Key Message; Machine Learning Models; Machine-learning; Resistance Mechanisms; Soybean [glycine Max (l.)

Irrigating with poor-quality groundwater may impair soil quality, limit the crop categories, and reduce agricultural productivity. In this study, 36 groundwater samples were collected to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes in the Yanggong River Basin of southwestern China. Results showed that the groundwater in the study area was slightly alkaline, predominantly dominated by moderately to very hard-fresh HCO<inf>3</inf>-Ca type. Interactions between water and rocks, such as the dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals and cation exchange processes, dominated the groundwater chemistry. Furthermore, intensive agricultural activities mainly contributed to 18% of the groundwater samples exceeding the standard concerning NO<inf>3</inf>-. The SAR and %Na values indicated excellent to good suitability for irrigation. Most groundwater samples, as shown by the Wilcox diagram, were categorized as appropriate for agricultural use with minimal risk to crops and soils. 21.62% of the EC values classified as doubtful and the result of the USSL diagram suggested potential salinity hazards that require further monitoring and management in the study area. The irrigation water quality index (IWQI) results showed that 86.49% of groundwater samples were classified as good and 13.51% were medium. And the sensitivity analysis confirmed the reliability of the IWQI assessment result.

In the literature, models have been developed to predict potato yield evolution due to climate change, projecting a decrease in production across various regions. This study was conducted on field data collected over 31 years in five contrasting sites in the Western Alps, Switzerland. Results show that 24 % of yield variation can be explained by the genotype, and 50 % by the environment. Among the studied meteorological conditions influencing the yield, 1) “total precipitation from tuber initiation to tuber harvest”, 2) “sum of solar irradiation from planting to maturity”, 3) “average temperature from planting to maturity” and, 4) “sum of daily maximal temperature from planting to maturity”, were the most important variables. The third variable exhibits a positive linear relationship with yield up to an average temperature of 16.5 °C during the growth season. Beyond this threshold, the relationship becomes negative and results in yield loss. Using this unprecedented dataset, we estimated potential yield losses in the Western Alps of Switzerland by the end of the century under three different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (i.e. 2.6, 4.5, 8.5). In the short term, by 2035, yield losses are projected to range from 3.2 % to 15.0 % regardless of the scenarios. By 2060, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 predict the highest losses, reaching 22.7–50.3 % compared to the 1990–2020 average yield. The most significant loss was predicted under the RCP 8.5 long-term scenario, by 2085, with yield losses ranging from 24.2 % to 84.6 %. These losses are attributed to an estimated precipitation decrease of 42 % compared to the average of the past 30 years and a +7.2 °C increase in average temperature during the potato growth season. Except in the case of RCP 2.6, which estimates low yield losses compared to 1990–2020, this study anticipates significant yield losses by the end of the century in Switzerland. To mitigate these losses due to climate change, potential adaptation strategies include the adoption of drought or heat-stress-resistant genotypes, enhancements in irrigation systems, adjustments of planting schedules, and relocating planting sites to higher elevations. In addition, the G x E interaction effect should be considered in breeding strategies, to cope with climate change impacts on potato yield and to grow genotypes better adapted to their environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Drought; Machine Learning; S.

These pests undergo multiple generations per year, leading to escalating infestations. In the current review, we first introduced the occurrence patterns and economic losses caused by stem borers in China. Then, we compared current integrated pest management (IPM) strategies for stem borers including chemical communication, biological control, pesticides and resistant varieties domestic and international.

This study aims to improve wheat yield prediction by integrating process-based models (PBM), machine learning (ML), and remote sensing (RS) techniques. Three Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) wheat models were calibrated and evaluated using field data from three wheat cultivars grown over three seasons in diverse environments. We developed a hybrid PBM-ML-RS approach using polynomial regression to generate iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) content from nitrogen predictions. The DSSAT wheat models slightly overestimated wheat yield but accurately predicted nitrogen content. The hybrid PBM-ML-RS approach closely estimated Fe and Zn content with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.42 t/ha for yield and 0.89 % for nitrogen content. The integration of ML and RS improved the prediction accuracy for Fe and Zn, achieving RMSE values of 0.35 % and 0.28 % respectively. Spatial simulations provided detailed geographic estimations of wheat yield and nutrient content, supporting site-specific management practices. This study demonstrates the potential of combining PBM, ML, and RS for comprehensive yield and nutrition prediction. The findings indicate a modest decrease in protein, Fe, and Zn concentrations with increasing grain yield, exhibiting high variability across different sites and cultivars.

There is a well-established understanding of the impacts of climate change on crop yields, while its impacts on crop quality are often overlooked. Given the critical role of wheat in global food security and the ongoing climate change, it is essential to explore the climate drivers in shaping wheat quality. This study utilized county-level survey data encompassing eight quality indicators of wheat grain, flour, and dough during 2006–2019 acquired from 363 counties in the North China Plain, the biggest wheat-producing region in China. The complex association between variation in climate factors and wheat quality was explored using an interpretable machine learning framework. The results revealed that while technological advancements and change in cultivars have improved most quality indicators, especially for dough quality, climate variation during the entire growth period accounts for 10.7 % to 25.7 % of the variations in indicators. Water-related factors had a stronger impact on wheat quality than temperature-related factors. In irrigated zones, precipitation primarily governed test weight and falling number, whereas soil moisture played a key role in determining protein and wet gluten content. In rainfed zones, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was the primary climatic driver of variations in test weight and falling number, while extremely high temperatures predominantly influenced protein and wet gluten content. Additionally, the SPEI exhibits interaction on most indicators with normal growing degree days (GDD). Specifically, the interactive effects between GDD and SPEI reduce dough quality under warm, dry conditions. Conversely, under warm, wet conditions, this interaction negatively impacts test weight and falling number. These findings underscore the importance of drought and the threshold effects of water availability in wheat quality prediction and adaptation, providing an overview of critical quality traits most susceptible to climate and climate extremes variations during the growing season. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Impacts; Drought; Food Security; Machine Learning; Regional Scale; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Climate Signal; Climate Variation; Drought; Environmental Factor; Evapotranspiration; Food Security; Growth Rate; Wheat; Winter; China; North China Plain,climate change; climate effect; climate signal; climate variation; drought; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; food security; growth rate; wheat; winter; China; North China Plain,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003255913

The design features a dynamic scissor mechanism that allows for precise adjustments in both width and height. This enables the equipment to easily adapt to different crop geometries, particularly in the case of tomatoes, wheat, sugar, and potatoes. The ability to adapt is crucial in order to effectively tackle the diverse array of disease threats that these crops face. An integrated deep-learning model has been implemented to address the pressing issue of disease identification, prompted by the elevated disease prevalence in crops. The model improves disease prediction accuracy by utilizing a rich dataset of tomato leaf pictures and employing advanced techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG-16, VGG16 with transfer learning, ResNet with Transfer Learning, and VGG with XGBoost. The system uses smart sensing to detect pests and weeds and distribute chemicals selectively. This reduces waste and environmental effects and improves disease prediction, which is difficult to do manually in fields. The model predicts nearly ten tomato disease classes, with VGG-16 being the most accurate at 94.70%. This research shows how the sprayer's mechanical design and deep learning model work together, advancing precision agriculture technologies. The sprayer's mechanical adaptability and AI-driven disease detection create a flexible, sustainable, and efficient answer for modern farming problems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cnn; Precision Agriculture; Resnet; Robotics; Scissor Mechanism; Tomato Disease; Transfer Learning; Vgg16,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008330368

Remote sensing technologies have emerged as valuable tools for diagnosing and monitoring these issues. They offer significant advantages over traditional methods, which are often time-consuming and limited in sampling. High-resolution images from drones and satellites provide fast and accurate solutions for detecting and diagnosing crops’ health and identifying pests and diseases affecting them. Methods: The research focused on the early detection of Cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora beticola Sacc.) and powdery mildew (Erysiphe betae (Vaňha) Weltzien), which cause significant economic losses in sugar beet before visible symptoms emerge. The study was accomplished by capturing images of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) in field conditions. To effectively evaluate different detection methods in agricultural contexts, the study targeted two key areas: (1) monitoring Cercospora in fields without pesticide application, utilizing the Metos climate station early warning system alongside UAV-based image analysis, and (2) monitoring powdery mildew, which involved visual disease detection and targeted spraying based on UAV image processing. Trial plots were established for this purpose, with six replications for each method. Results: UAV-based images show that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values in leaves decreased before disease onset. This change is an important warning sign for the emergence of the disease. Additionally, the study demonstrated that early detection of diseases is possible using K-nearest neighbors and logistic regression algorithms, exhibiting high discrimination and predictive accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Early Detection; Leaf Diseases; Machine Learning; Multispectral Imaging; Plant Disease Management; Time-series Evaluation; Pesticide; Sugar; Algorithm; Article; Cercospora Beticola; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Leaf Spot; Learning; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Plant Disease; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Powdery Mildew; Remote Sensing; Sugar Beet; Time Series Analysis; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Vegetation,pesticide; sugar; algorithm; Article; Cercospora beticola; controlled study; deep learning; image analysis; image processing; leaf spot; learning; machine learning; nonhuman; plant disease; plant growth; plant leaf; powdery mildew; remote sensing; sugar beet; time series analysis; unmanned aerial vehicle; vegetation,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008324233

While fertilizers have improved crop yields, they have also contributed to environmental degradation due to nutrient overuse, particularly nitrogen. Effective nitrogen management is therefore critical for achieving sustainable agricultural practices. This study investigates nitrogen dynamics in soil and reviews key analytical methods for monitoring total, mineral, and organic nitrogen. It evaluates protocols and technologies—including sensor-based systems—designed to optimize nitrogen application and reduce losses. The study demonstrates that the application of nitrogen fertilizers based on soil analysis and exploratory simulations, supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), can reduce inputs without compromising yield or quality parameters. Enhanced nitrogen monitoring techniques can significantly contribute to the goals of the Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) and promote sustainable farming, especially in regions facing environmental and technical limitations. Adoption, however, depends on overcoming challenges such as sensor affordability and farmer training.

In this study, we established three experimental fields, which were planted with three main sugarcane cultivars in Guangxi, China, respectively, implementing a multi-gradient fertilization design with 39 plots and 810 sampling grids. Multispectral imagery was acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during five critical growth stages: mid-tillering (T1), late-tillering (T2), mid-elongation (T3), late-elongation (T4), and maturation (T5). Following rigorous image preprocessing (including stitching, geometric correction, and radiometric correction), 16 VIs were extracted. To identify yield-sensitive vegetation indices (VIs), a spectral feature selection criterion combining gray relational analysis and correlation analysis (GRD-r) was proposed. Subsequently, three supervised learning algorithms—Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—were employed to develop both single-stage and multi-stage yield prediction models. Results demonstrated that multi-stage models consistently outperformed their single-stage counterparts. Among the single-stage models, the RF model using T3-stage features achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.78, RMSE<inf>V</inf> = 7.47 t/hm2).

Predicting crop yield based on soil characteristics, macro, micro nutrients, temperature, and humidity has been extensively studied using machine learning and deep learning models. The primary objective of the research is to develop a comprehensive model for crop recommendation and yield prediction for three crops—grapes, beans, and chilies—based on macronutrients and micronutrients. The analyzed nutrients include nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, carbon, sulfur, magnesium, iron, boron, zinc, and calcium, along with natural soil factors such as soil type, pH, humidity, and pesticide presence. The proposed methodology analyzes both tabular and image data for the three crops—grapes, beans, and chilies. The main contribution of this study is the development of two different methods for crop recommendation through yield prediction. The feature selection process is performed using a proposed nsemble model called Random Forest Regressor with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFR-RFE), followed by an Ensemble Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. The RFR-RFE method extracts optimal crop-specific features from the attribute set, which then serve as inputs for a hybrid model called Hybrid Deep Neural Network with Multi-Layer Perceptron (Hybrid DNN-MLP). The proposed Hybrid DNN-MLP model is compared with other machine learning models, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF), to evaluate performance. The extracted optimal features for each crop are used to train three models—DNN-MLP, Random Forest, and Regression models—to predict crop yield. The yield predictions are then used to rank crop production. The performance of the machine learning models is assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) values, which help in ranking and recommending the most suitable crop for a given area. The proposed Hybrid DNN-MLP model achieved an R2 of 0.98 for grapes, 0.98 for beans, and 0.98 for chilies, outperforming Random Forest (0.97 for grapes and 0.98 for beans) and Multiple Linear Regression (0.91 for grapes and 0.93 for beans). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid model in accurately predicting crop yield and optimizing recommendations for agricultural planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agriculture; Artificial Neural Network; Machine Learning; Multi Layered Perceptron; Regression,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007939736

This study is based on an experiment conducted by researchers from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who employed a UAV-mounted LiDAR and multispectral imaging sensors to monitor two sugarcane field trials subjected to varying nitrogen (N) fertilization regimes in the Wet Tropics region of Australia. The predictive performance of models utilizing multispectral features, LiDAR-derived features, and a fusion of both modalities was evaluated against a benchmark model based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This work utilizes the dataset produced by this experiment, incorporating other regressors and features derived from those collected in the field. Typically, crop yield prediction relies on features derived from direct field observations, either gathered through sensor measurements or manual data collection. However, enhancing prediction models by incorporating new features extracted through regressions executed on the original dataset features can potentially improve predictive outcomes. These extracted features, nominated in this work as meta-features (MFs), extracted through regressions with different regressors on original features, and incorporated into the dataset as new feature predictors, can be utilized in further regression analyses to optimize crop yield prediction. This study investigates the potential of generating MFs as an innovation to enhance sugarcane crop yield predictions. MFs were generated based on the values obtained by different regressors applied to the features collected in the field, allowing for evaluating which approaches offered superior predictive performance within the dataset. The kNN meta-regressor outperforms other regressors because it takes advantage of the proximity of MFs, which was checked through a projection where the dispersion of points can be measured. A comparative analysis is presented with a projection based on the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm, showing that MFs had more proximity than the original features when projected, which demonstrates that MFs revealed a clear formation of well-defined clusters, with most points within each group sharing the same color, suggesting greater uniformity in the predicted values. Incorporating these MFs into subsequent regression models demonstrated improved performance, with (Formula presented.) values higher than 0.9 for MF Grad Boost M3, MF GradientBoost M5, and all kNN MFs and reduced error margins compared to field-measured yield values. The (Formula presented.) values obtained in this work ranged above 0.98 for the AdaBoost meta-regressor applied to MFs, which were obtained from kNN regression on five models created by the researchers of CSIRO, and around 0.99 for the kNN meta-regressor applied to MFs obtained from kNN regression on these five models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agronomic Data; Crop Yield Prediction; Lidar Data; Machine Learning; Meta-feature; Multispectral Data; Sugarcane; Supervised Learning Methods; Vegetative Indices; Agricultural Robots; Crops; Fertilizers; Fruits; Harvesters; Linear Regression; Pesticides; Seed; Agronomic Data; Crop Yield; Crop Yield Prediction; Lidar Data; Machine-learning; Metafeature; Multi-spectral; Multispectral Data; Sugarcane; Supervised Learning Methods; Vegetative Index; Yield Prediction; Sugar Cane,Agricultural robots; Crops; Fertilizers; Fruits; Harvesters; Linear regression; Pesticides; Seed; Agronomic data; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Lidar data; Machine-learning; Metafeature; Multi-spectral; Multispectral data; Sugarcane; Supervised learning methods; Vegetative index; Yield prediction; Sugar cane,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007768728

Alfalfa genotypes were subjected to treatments with SA (1 and 2 mM), MgO NPs (5 and 20 ppm), and SA + MgO NPs, followed by exposure to cold stress at 10 °C and 4 °C for 14 days each. Changes in biochemical parameters, scanning electron microscope (SEM) image analysis, and alterations in miRNA (miRNA156 and miRNA173) gene expression levels were examined to assess the mitigating effects of the treatments on cold-induced damage. The results indicate that under cold conditions, SA and MgO NPs singularly reduced lipid peroxidation (LPO) and hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) contents while increasing proline content.

Consumed all around the globe due to it being rich in nutrients such as vitamins, antioxidants, and for being high in fibre. These are nutritional qualities that help with digestion, immune-system, and minimizing inflammation. It is a common issue among farmers to have to deal with various diseases in cauliflower leaves that are difficult to diagnose in their early stages. These diseases have a tendency to propagate in a really swift pace throughout entire fields worth of crops. This in-turn causes heavy losses in the harvest, and makes it much more tedious and resource-intensive to protect the crops. As a result, farmers get more likely to use high amounts of pesticides and harmful chemicals to streamline the process of getting a more reliable yield on their crops. This is not only costly, but it is also harmful both to the quality of crops and to the well-being of the environment. In this publication, we are introducing a dataset containing a considerable number of images of cauliflower leaves. This is intended to drive development on this topic at a faster pace than it is now, and to help enhance disease monitoring, diagnosis, and precautionary techniques. We collected our dataset images between November 2024 and January 2025. In this dataset, cauliflower leaves were categorized into three classes: Healthy, Insect Holes, and Black Rot, each reflecting a specific condition that impacts plant health at different stages. This dataset consists of 2,661 images. The pictures were captured at different locations in Bangladesh, under different weather conditions, dates, temperatures, and with different devices. To enhance the data quality, we used several steps to process the dataset, making sure it would reflect real-world conditions and be ready for training. The images were resized to a standard size of 3000 × 3000 pixels, brightness was adjusted to make the images more easily discernible, and we removed duplicates and poor-quality images. These actions helped ensure the dataset was in the best possible shape for effective model training. This dataset will be highly effective for agricultural research, precision agriculture, and effective management of diseases. It should help develop highly accurate machine learning models for early detection of Cauliflower leaf diseases. The dataset is employed to train deep learning models to support automated monitoring and smart decision-making in precision agriculture. This data set also has immense potential for real-time and practical use. It can be utilized to develop applications like mobile apps or automated systems where farmers can easily identify diseases at early stages and take immediate action, without the requirement of expert on-site knowledge. This data set can also be utilized with smart farming equipment like drones and sensors to track big fields in real time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Dataset; Cauliflower Leaf Disease; Deep Learning; Disease Detection; Image Dataset; Crop Protection; Fertilizers; Insect Control; Vegetables; Agricultural Dataset; Cauliflower Leaf Disease; Cauliflower Leaves; Condition; Data Set; Deep Learning; Disease Detection; Image Datasets; Leaf Disease; Precision Agriculture; Pesticides,Crop protection; Fertilizers; Insect control; Vegetables; Agricultural dataset; Cauliflower leaf disease; Cauliflower leaves; Condition; Data set; Deep learning; Disease detection; Image datasets; Leaf disease; Precision Agriculture; Pesticides,Data paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004553405

Being a staple contributor to the Indian economy, these losses can cause large problems in other sectors as well. Most computerized methods involve some form of Deep Learning algorithms and models to automate the detection process. Although these models need large amounts of data to operate, their accuracy and precision far beat traditional machine learning methods. Still, most of these existing models tend to operate on datasets of particular crops. This paper proposes a lightweight model named Plantention, built on the MobileNetV2 encoder with a softmax classifier as a general-purpose classifier for five major crops grown in India, namely Rice, Wheat, Tea, Banana, and Sugarcane. Plantention uses a dual split attention network with residual classifiers to improve the classification of the individual leaf diseases using. Compared to CBAM and soft attention networks that simply accentuate the disease features on the leaf, the dual split attention mechanism utilizes both the leaf features and the leaf disease features by combining them to classify the leaf disease. The experimentation has been performed on five different publicly available datasets. The model performance was assessed using comprehensive performance metrics, and the model achieved an accuracy of 98.34 %, precision of 98.74 %, recall of 99.19 %, and F1 Score of 99.02 %. In addition, the model has around 7.3 million parameters, making it incredibly lightweight and very ready for deployment in low-computing technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computer Vision; Crop Disease; Deep Learning; Image Classification; Mobilenet; Agricultural Robots; Fruits; Grain (agricultural Product); Image Classification; Seed; Sugar Cane; Crop Disease; Crop Leaves; Deep Learning; Disease Cause; Disease Classification; Diseases Features; Images Classification; Leaf Disease; Mobilenet; Split Attentions,Agricultural robots; Fruits; Grain (agricultural product); Image classification; Seed; Sugar cane; Crop disease; Crop leaves; Deep learning; Disease cause; Disease classification; Diseases features; Images classification; Leaf disease; Mobilenet; Split attentions,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003825768

There are different options within the scope of remote sensing for the early detection of diseases. Among these, choosing a method that can detect diseases accurately without harming the plant and the environment is important. Today, positive developments have been made toward non-invasive and effective detection of diseases with thermal camera-based image processing techniques. In this context, there is potential for disease detection with data collection, image processing, and the determination of the characteristics of disease agents through thermal imaging. The research was based on Cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora beticola Sacc.) diseases which have significant economic loss potential in sugar beet. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated in experiments involving Cercospora beticola, utilizing a climate station early warning system and UAV-based thermal images across three subjects and six replicate field trial plots. Analyses were made for the early detection of diseases by comparing thermal images taken from the field with multispectral images taken simultaneously. It was investigated whether it was possible to diagnose the disease early before physical symptoms were seen using image processing and machine learning methods. The variability of leaves was analyzed using field images, thermal images, and machine learning algorithms. Thermal imaging enables the rapid detection of potential disease development by measuring increases in leaf temperature in infrared wavelengths. However, a significant limitation of this method in practice is its sensitivity to climate factors such as air temperature and humidity, which can cause rapid fluctuations in the index. This study compared five machine learning algorithms based on four key metrics. MS imaging achieved about 25% higher accuracy in predicting early disease than TE imaging. This study indicates that thermal imaging provides valuable information but is not as effective as multispectral imaging in detecting early-stage stress factors related to diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Early Detection; Leaf Diseases Detection; Machine Learning; Plant Disease Management; Remote Sensing; Thermal Imaging,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003426640

Tobamoviruses are among the most destructive plant viruses and threaten global food security. It is generally accepted that +ssRNA viruses including tobamoviruses encode proteins solely on their positive strand (+RNA). Here, we identified additional open-reading frames (ORFs) in the negative strand of tobamoviruses, named reverse ORFs (rORFs). Using cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) as a model, we detected the corresponding peptides of rORFs by mass spectrometry analysis and confirmed the translation of rORFs by ribosome profiling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these rORFs may be translated from an internal ribosome entry site. Mutation of rORF1 and rORF2 significantly reduced the virulence of CGMMV, whereas ectopic expression of rORF1 and rORF2 could rescue the pathogenicity of the mutants. While the rORF2 protein localizes at the cell membrane and in the nucleolus, rORF1 colocalizes with peroxisomes, where it interacts with the viral 126-kD replication protein. Additionally, we screened peroxisomal rORF1-interacting proteins using artificial intelligence tools and found that PEX3 mediated rORF1 targeting to peroxisomes. This study reveals that the tobamoviral proteome is larger than previously thought, and sheds light on peroxisomes as novel virulence targets important for virus infectivity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic Virus; Peroxisomes; Positive-sense Single-stranded Rna Viruses; Small Orfs; Tobamoviruses; Virus Pathogenicity; Viral Proteins; Viral Protein; Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic Virus; Genetics; Metabolism; Mutation; Nicotiana; Open Reading Frame; Pathogenicity; Peroxisome; Plant Disease; Tobamovirus; Virology; Virulence; Mutation; Open Reading Frames; Peroxisomes; Plant Diseases; Viral Proteins; Virulence,viral protein; Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus; genetics; metabolism; mutation; Nicotiana; open reading frame; pathogenicity; peroxisome; plant disease; Tobamovirus; virology; virulence; Mutation; Open Reading Frames; Peroxisomes; Plant Diseases; Viral Proteins; Virulence,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001840809

As one of the world's largest consumers of soybeans, China heavily relies on soybean imports, making increased soybean yields an effective way to address the shortage of soybean resources. As soil salinization becoming increasingly severe, salt stress has become a major factor affecting soybean yield and quality in China. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for identifying salt stress levels in soybean seedlings using RGB images of their leaves. In this framework, a Convolutional Neural Network combined with a Convolutional Block Attention Module is used to extract image features; a dimensionality reduction method is employed to remove redundancy from the extracted features; and a machine learning classifier is used to classify the reduced features. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework can accurately identify salt stress levels from soybean leaf images while overcoming the overfitting problem associated with small datasets.

However, traditional methods are constrained by reliance on empirical knowledge, time-consuming processes, resource intensiveness, and spatial-temporal variability in prediction accuracy. This study presented a plot-level approach that leverages UAV technology and recurrent neural networks to provide field yield predictions within the same growing season, addressing a significant gap in previous research that often focuses on regional scale predictions relied on multi-year history datasets. End-of-season yield and quality parameters were forecasted using UAV-derived time series data and meteorological factors collected at three critical growth stages, providing a timely and practical tool for farm management. Two years of data covering 185 sugar beet varieties were used to train a developed stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which was compared with traditional machine learning approaches. Incorporating fresh weight estimates of aboveground and root biomass as predictive factors significantly enhanced prediction accuracy. Optimal performance in prediction was observed when utilizing data from all three growth periods, with R2 values of 0.761 (rRMSE = 7.1 %) for sugar content, 0.531 (rRMSE = 22.5 %) for root yield, and 0.478 (rRMSE = 23.4 %) for sugar yield. Furthermore, combining data from the first two growth periods shows promising results for making the predictions earlier. Key predictive features identified through the Permutation Importance (PIMP) method provided insights into the main factors influencing yield.

Aeroponics has rapidly gained recognition as a truly green and environmentally sustainable method of agriculture over the last decade. This soil-free cultivation method presents a promising approach, offering increased yields and precise nutrient control facilitated by automated systems. However, it poses significant challenges, notably the need for real-time monitoring and tailored nutrient composition. A critical limitation of this method is the potential for delayed response times of the automated system, which can result in plant mortality or suboptimal growth and yield production. This highlights the importance of developing more advanced monitoring systems with predictive capabilities. This study explores the synergistic integration of automation and machine learning in aeroponics, emphasizing precision nutrient management of irrigation water to augment plant growth and productivity. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning over a year that encompasses key parameters such as NPK concentrations, pH levels, and total dissolved solids (TDS), the model exhibiting superior performance was subsequently selected for implementation. The chosen model operates with an automated pH regulation mechanism and another control system incorporating environmental variables, including temperature and humidity. This integrated approach enables the optimization of the water delivery system, thereby promoting enhanced plant growth and overall system efficiency. The system's architecture comprises both backend and frontend elements. The Edge Computing platform is the primary processing unit, providing centralized computational resources. In tandem, the Arduino Uno microcontroller is utilized for data acquisition and system regulation, facilitating the collection of sensory data and execution of control commands. A desktop application enables users to select the plant type, specify the water quantity in the reservoir, and choose between indoor and outdoor modes. It also offers a system override feature, allowing manual control of shower duration. Additionally, the system provides real-time sensor data, monitors plant health status, and generates TDS alerts, ensuring optimal growing conditions. Notably, the observed yield significantly increases, approximately doubling that of conventional agricultural methods.

However, they have been largely overlooked in studies on microplastic (MP) toxicity. MPs and plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) are ubiquitous in soil due to plant litter decomposition and heavy MP contamination, inevitably interacting and exerting combined toxicity on soil organisms. However, little research has been conducted on their joint effects. This study investigates the individual and combined toxic effects of polyethylene (PE) MPs and three PSMs (glycyrrhizic acid, tannic acid, and matrine) on the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Physiological and biochemical responses were assessed using fluorescence microscopy, image analysis, and statistical methods. After 42 h of exposure to PE MPs and/or PSMs, worm growth and development were negatively impacted. Under experimental conditions, matrine and PE MPs synergistically inhibited worm growth, exacerbated neurological damage, and induced oxidative stress.

However, comprehensive research on the combined impacts of these two practices remains insufficient, and there is a lack of quantitative analyses on a large regional scale as well as identification of the main drivers. Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the impact of mineral N management and organic matter management on rice yield and global warming potential (GWP) and their spatial distribution patterns, and to investigate influential factors. Methods: We combined machine learning algorithms based on meta-analysis to assess the effect of mineral N management (synthetic N fertilizer, slow-/controlled- release fertilizer) and organic matter management (organic fertilizer, biochar amendment, and straw return) on rice yield and GHG in the rice-wheat system by compiling 163 peer-reviewed journal articles and high-resolution multi-source databases in China. Results: Mineral N management significantly increased rice yield (412 %) and N<inf>2</inf>O (162.3 %), and reduced GHG emissions intensity (GHGI; 20.1 %). Organic matter management increased CH<inf>4</inf>, GWP, and GHGI by 74.4 %, 60.8 %, and 55.1 %, respectively. Machine learning (random forest (RF), support vector machine, multiple layer perceptron, and gradient boosting machine) suggested that RF was the optimal method for predicting rice yield and GHG (R2 = 0.43–0.90). The spatial distribution indicated that mineral N management boosted rice yield and N<inf>2</inf>O while reducing GHGI, especially in the Middle-lower Yangtze River (MLY) region, by 37.6 %, 277 %, and 25.2 %, respectively. Structural equation modeling and RF analysis revealed that field management practices and edaphic factors had major contributions to rice yield, while climatic factors were positively with CH<inf>4</inf> and N<inf>2</inf>O emissions. Implications: Our findings provide insights into the importance of inorganic and organic managements to ensure food security and environmental sustainability, thereby contributing to the promotion of sustainable rice production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Global Warming Potential; Machine Learning Algorithm; Random Forest; Rice Yield; Rice-wheat System; Algorithm; Biochar; Crop Rotation; Crop Yield; Farming System; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gas; Machine Learning; Rice; Soil Emission; Soil Organic Matter; China; Yangtze River,algorithm; biochar; crop rotation; crop yield; farming system; global warming; greenhouse gas; machine learning; rice; soil emission; soil organic matter; China; Yangtze River,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000582024

While traditional diagnostic methods provide precise measurements of phytohormones such as salicylic acid (SA), a key regulator of plant defence responses, their reliance on bulky equipment and lengthy analysis times limits field applicability. This study presents a microfluidic-based aptamer assay for SA detection, enabling rapid and sensitive fluorescence-based readout from plant samples. A tailored sample pre-treatment protocol was developed and validated with real strawberry samples using HPLC measurements. The assay demonstrated a detection limit ranging from 10−9 to 10−6 mg/mL, within the relevant range for early infection diagnosis.

However, nearly 50% of applied nitrogen fertilizers are lost to the environment, causing pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Biochar-based fertilizers (BBFs), combining biochar with chemical fertilizers, enhance nutrient efficiency, boost crop yields, and reduce N<inf>2</inf>O emissions. However, comprehensive field studies on BBF impacts remain limited. This study uses a global dataset of BBF field experiments to build predictive models with three machine learning algorithms for crop yields and N<inf>2</inf>O emissions, and to assess BBFs’ potential to increase yields and mitigate emissions in China’s major crops. The artificial neural network (ANN) model outperformed random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) in predicting N<inf>2</inf>O emissions (R2: 0.99; EF: 0.99), while all models showed high accuracy for crop yields (R2, EF: 0.98–0.99).

Even with the continuous development of AI in agriculture in general and apples in particular, automated systems continue to encounter challenges identifying rotten fruit and variations within the same apple category, as well as similarity in type, color, and shape of different fruit varieties. These issues, in addition to apple diseases, substantially impact the economy, productivity, and marketing quality. In this paper, we first provide a novel comprehensive collection named Apple Fruit Varieties Collection (AFVC) with 29,750 images through 85 classes. Second, we distinguish fresh and rotten apples with Apple Fruit Quality Categorization (AFQC), which has 2,320 photos. Third, an Apple Diseases Extensive Collection (ADEC), comprised of 2,976 images with seven classes, was offered. Fourth, following the state of the art, we develop an Optimized Apple Orchard Model (OAOM) with a new loss function named measured focal cross-entropy (MFCE), which assists in improving the proposed model’s efficiency. The proposed OAOM gives the highest performance for apple varieties identification with AFVC; accuracy was 93.85%. For the apples rotten recognition with AFQC, accuracy was 98.28%. For the identification of the diseases via ADEC, it was 99.66%. OAOM works with high efficiency and outperforms the baselines. The suggested technique boosts apple system automation with numerous duties and outstanding effectiveness.

This study employed machine learning to optimize macronutrient concentrations during the cultivation of Phalaenopsis orchids. A dataset was generated by investigating the effects of various macronutrient levels on the morphological and biochemical traits of plantlets. An innovative iterative prediction scheme based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) was utilized to identify the optimal macronutrient levels necessary for enhancing plant morphology and biochemistry. The modeling results indicated that doubling the nitrate concentration, combined with a 2.2% increase in potassium and a 5.3% increase in phosphorus compared to the half-strength MS medium, yielded the most favorable morphological traits. Additionally, the model demonstrated that a twofold increase in nitrate, along with a 2.7% increase in potassium and a 4.7% increase in phosphorus, significantly improved biochemical characteristics, including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids. To investigate the possibility of introducing a single optimal point for the improvement of both morphological and biochemical traits, new plants were cultivated by doubling the nitrate content, a 2.5% increase in potassium, and a 5.0% increase in phosphorus, all compared with the control, i.e., half-strength MS medium. Remarkable enhancements were observed in plant physiology and biochemistry, achieving over a 50% increase in morphological traits and a 200% increase in biochemical traits.

In this study, we identified 107 JAZ distributed across 8 chromosomes in lily. Promoter analysis predicted 27 distributed cis-elements that respond to diverse signals. Gene duplication analysis suggests the tandem duplication might be a potential mechanism for the expansion of this family. Our results highlight the expression patterns of 107 JAZ genes in bulb development. The expression of LfJAZ3 and LfJAZ12, exhibits significant changes during bulb development. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated the LfJAZ3 and LfJAZ12 proteins interaction with transcription factors MYC2. The silencing of LfJAZ3 and LfJAZ12 via virus-induced gene silencing resulted in increases in bulb weight and diameter, confirming their regulatory role. Silencing LfJAZ3 and LfJAZ12 enhances bulb development by upregulating key genes involved in sugar metabolism, suggesting that JAZ acts as a transcriptional repressor in this process.

It is the main source of income in India's rural areas. However, the yield rate of crops is undesirable in India. Some challenges faced by farmers are, dealing with uncertain climate, shortage of important minerals in soil due to soil erosion, and cultivating without crop rotation. This paper proposes a crop recommender and crop yield prediction system for farmers using machine learning algorithms. It is necessary to collect and preprocess a large amount of data, including soil characteristics, weather patterns, historical crop yields, and specific crop requirements. Then using this data, machine learning models are trained to forecast which crop would be best under particular factors. Farmers input their local conditions using the system's interface, and they will quickly obtain personalized crop suggestions. Here we used the ensemble technique to obtain better results. The base learners are SVM, KNN, random forest, decision tree classifier, and Naive Bayes. These learners are ensembled by using the voting classifier technique and the best is selected for obtaining the result. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agriculture; Challenges; Crop Recommender; Machine Learning Algorithms; Yield Rate,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216825799

A deep synaptic neural framework is proposed, which includes an object detection network and a multi-modal regressive convolutional neural network. A pair of separate databases, FruitNet360++ and FruitBox++, have been rigorously chosen to assist the tasks performed within the framework. The FruitRecognition dataset underwent meticulous restructuring based on geographic origin, enhancing the effectiveness of fruit quality detection and localization. Utilizing the YOLOv8 methodology, our framework achieved an impressive average mean accuracy score (mAP) of 92.1%, underscoring its robustness in accurately identifying and localizing fruits within images. Furthermore, the model exhibits proficiency in species identification 97.7%, origin determination 98.9%, and sweetness prediction. Incorporating the representational learning features of residual networks, the framework was very good at estimating the numerical weights of fruit boxes. It attained a best-case mean square error (MSE) of 0.002 with orange, topping other fruit types in precision. Furthermore, in sweetness prediction, the framework achieved a noteworthy MSE of 0.003, exhibiting its ability to accurately assess subtle features of fruit quality. The research focuses on fully automated fruit weight estimation and yield prediction, particularly for challenging varieties, which is significantly advancing the field. The framework is a leading option for automated fruit analysis based on extensive training and testing on large datasets. Future studies aim to refine distance estimates, broaden datasets, and enhance AI algorithms for comprehensive fruit trait evaluation, driving innovation and sustainable practices in agriculture.

Therefore, to enable sophisticated grading methods that efficiently sort and evaluate fruit quality based on various characteristics (such as form, color, size, texture, and other crucial parameters), A unique dataset is deployed to support advanced grading systems. This dataset helps researchers explore genetic variation, ecological adaptation, and environmental factors that affect fruit qualities for conservation and sustainable agriculture. Using a mobile camera, these data are personally collected at various times of the day at local markets in Bangladesh that receive optimal sunlight.

Despite the usage of chemical fungicides to combat the pathogen, their effectiveness remains limited in controlling blast disease. Consequently, there exists a pressing need to discover a novel natural biofungicide for efficient blast disease management. To address this challenge, we combined machine learning-based bioactivity prediction with virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the molecular interactions between forty-eight plant-derived natural compounds and the effector protein, Avr-PikE, an avirulence protein from Magnaporthe oryzae. Among the evaluated phytochemicals, Calotropin, Lupeol, and Azadirachtin emerged as the top-ranking molecules based on their favourable affinity through molecular docking with the effector. MD simulations for 100 ns were conducted to ascertain the stability and reliability of these compounds. Through classical and steered MD simulations and free energy calculations, it was revealed that these selected compounds exhibit stable and favourable energies, thereby establishing strong binding interactions with Avr-PikE. These screened natural metabolites were also found to meet crucial criteria for fungicide-likeness. To support accessibility and broader applications, we also developed a bioactivity prediction app (http://login1.cabgrid.res.in:5260/), allowing users to predict bioactivity against fungi based on our model. The efficacy of one potent compound, Lupeol, was validated through in vitro experiments, confirming its significant antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae.

To address this issue, this study developed an advanced yield prediction model, integrating traditional statistical methods with modern machine learning algorithms, including elastic net, random forest, and XGBoost. By incorporating satellite-derived vegetation indices (EVI2 and GOSIF) and climate variables (temperature and precipitation), the model accurately captures the complex non-linear relationships that affect yield outcomes. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis was performed to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying regional yield variations. Temperature and sunlight were found to be key determinants of motherwort yield, with genes associated with heat stress (e.g., heat shock proteins) and photosynthesis exhibiting higher expression levels in high-yield regions. These genetic insights provide crucial information for optimizing yield, revealing the plant's capacity to adapt to environmental stressors.

Genome sequencing advancements have led to the identification of a myriad of NLRs in numerous agriculturally important plant species. However, deciphering which NLRs recognize specific pathogen effectors remains challenging. Predicting NLR–effector interactions in silico will provide a more targeted approach for experimental validation, critical for elucidating function, and advancing our understanding of NLR-triggered immunity. In this study, NLR–effector protein complex structures were predicted using AlphaFold2-Multimer for all experimentally validated NLR–effector interactions reported in literature. Binding affinities- and energies were predicted using 97 machine learning models from Area-Affinity. We show that AlphaFold2-Multimer predicted structures have acceptable accuracy and can be used to investigate NLR–effector interactions in silico. Binding affinities for 58 NLR–effector complexes ranged between −8.5 and −10.6 log(K), and binding energies between −11.8 and −14.4 kcal/mol−1, depending on the Area-Affinity model used. For 2427 “forced” NLR–effector complexes, these estimates showed larger variability, enabling identification of novel NLR–effector interactions with 99% accuracy using an Ensemble machine learning model. The narrow range of binding energies- and affinities for “true” interactions suggest a specific change in Gibbs free energy, and thus conformational change, is required for NLR activation. This is the first study to provide a method for predicting NLR–effector interactions, applicable to all pathosystems. Finally, the NLR–Effector Interaction Classification (NEIC) resource can streamline research efforts by identifying NLRs important for plant–pathogen resistance, advancing our understanding of plant immunity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Effector; Effector Triggered Immunity; Nlr–effector Interactions; Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat; Plant–pathogen Interactions; Technical Advance; Leucine-rich Repeat Proteins; Nlr Proteins; Plant Proteins; Plant Diseases; Vegetation; Effector; Effector Triggered Immunity; Leucine-rich Repeats; Nucleotide Binding; Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat; Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat–effector Interaction; Plant/pathogen Interaction; Technical Advances; Binding Energy; Accuracy; Activation; Affinity; Binding; Leucine; Machinery; Plants; Structures; Leucine Rich Repeat Protein; Nucleotide Binding Oligomerization Domain Like Receptor; Plant Protein; Protein Binding; Chemistry; Computer Simulation; Genetics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Immunology; Machine Learning; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant; Plant Disease; Plant Immunity; Computer Simulation; Host-pathogen Interactions; Leucine-rich Repeat Proteins; Machine Learning; Nlr Proteins; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Protein Binding,Plant diseases; Vegetation; Effector; Effector triggered immunity; Leucine-rich repeats; Nucleotide binding; Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat; Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat–effector interaction; Plant/pathogen interaction; Technical advances; Binding energy; Accuracy; Activation; Affinity; Binding; Leucine; Machinery; Plants; Structures; leucine rich repeat protein; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; plant protein; protein binding; chemistry; computer simulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunology; machine learning; metabolism; microbiology; plant; plant disease; plant immunity; Computer Simulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Leucine-Rich Repeat Proteins; Machine Learning; NLR Proteins; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Protein Binding,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004204267

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of various modeling approaches, including a heteroskedastic gamma regression model, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks, in predicting sugarcane yield based on satellite-derived vegetation indices and environmental variables. Key covariates analyzed include sugarcane varieties, production cycles, accumulated precipitation during the growth phase, and the mean GNDVI vegetation index. The analysis was conducted in two locations over two consecutive growing seasons. The research emphasizes the integration of satellite data with advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to enhance yield prediction in agricultural systems, specifically focusing on sugarcane cultivation.

Understanding the dynamics of CW growth is crucial for optimizing crop yields. In this study, we employed onion (Allium cepa L.) epidermis as a model system, leveraging its layered organization to investigate growth stages. Microscopic analysis revealed proportional variations in cell size in different epidermal layers, offering insights into growth dynamics and CW structural adaptations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) identified 11 distinct spectral intervals associated with CW components, highlighting structural modifications that influence wall elasticity and rigidity. Biochemical assays across developmental layers demonstrated variations in cellulose, soluble sugars, and antioxidant content, reflecting biochemical shifts during growth. The differential expression of ten cell wall enzyme (CWE) genes, analyzed via RT-qPCR, revealed significant correlations between gene expression patterns and CW composition changes across developmental layers. Notably, the gene expression levels of the pectin methylesterase and fucosidase enzymes were associated with the contents in cellulose, soluble sugar, and antioxidants. To complement these findings, machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Neural Networks, were employed to integrate FTIR data, biochemical parameters, and CWE gene expression profiles. Our models achieved high accuracy in predicting growth stages. This underscores the intricate interplay among CW composition, CW enzymatic activity, and growth dynamics, providing a predictive framework with applications in enhancing crop productivity and sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Allium Cepal; Cell Wall Composition; Cell Wall Enzymes; Machine Learning; Modeling; Onion Epidermis; Plant Growth; Alpha Levo Fucosidase; Cellulose; Pectinesterase; Phenol; Cellulose; Alpha Levo Fucosidase; Antioxidant; Carbohydrate; Cellulose; Flavonoid; Nutraceutical; Pectinesterase; Phenol; Plant Protein; Sugar; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Biochemical Analysis; Cell Size; Cell Structure; Cell Wall; Classification; Controlled Study; Correlation Analysis; Data Accuracy; Differential Expression Analysis; Elasticity; Enzyme Activity; Epidermis Cell; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Gene Expression Level; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Growth Curve; Harvest; K Nearest Neighbor; Machine Learning; Microscopy; Molecular Biology; Nerve Cell Network; Nonhuman; Onion; Plant Epidermis; Plant Gene; Plant Growth; Plant Physiology; Prediction; Protein Expression Level; Quantitative Analysis; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rigidity; Structure Analysis; Support Vector Machine; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Cell Wall; Cellulose; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Machine Learning; Onions; Plant Epidermis; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Support Vector Machine","alpha levo fucosidase; antioxidant; carbohydrate; cellulose; flavonoid; nutraceutical; pectinesterase; phenol; plant protein; sugar; Article; artificial neural network; biochemical analysis; cell size; cell structure; cell wall; classification; controlled study; correlation analysis; data accuracy; differential expression analysis; elasticity; enzyme activity; epidermis cell; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gene expression level; gene expression profiling; genomics; growth curve; harvest; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; microscopy; molecular biology; nerve cell network; nonhuman; onion; plant epidermis; plant gene; plant growth; plant physiology; prediction; protein expression level; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; rigidity; structure analysis; support vector machine; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Cell Wall; Cellulose; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Machine Learning; Onions; Plant Epidermis; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Support Vector Machine",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002333989

This phenotypic heterogeneity can affect virulence in animals, but its impact on plant pathogens is unknown. Previously, we showed that expression of the type III secretion system (T3SS) of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae displays phenotypic variation in planta. Here we use flow cytometry and microscopy to investigate single-cell flagellar expression in relation to T3SS expression, showing that both systems undergo phenotypic heterogeneity in vitro in apoplast-mimicking medium and within apoplastic microcolonies throughout colonization of Phaseolus vulgaris. Stochastic, spatial and time factors shape the dynamics of a phenotypically diverse pathogen population that displays division of labour during colonization: effectors produced by T3SS-expressing bacteria act as ‘common goods’ to suppress immunity, allowing motile flagella-expressing bacteria to increase and leave infected tissue before necrosis.

This study developed a rapid workflow for sugarcane yield estimation by integrating remote sensing and meteorological datasets through machine learning (ML). The seven ML algorithms namely, “random forest (RF),” “support vector regression,” “decision tree (DT),” “K-nearest neighbors (KNN),” “XGBoost (XGB),” “Gradient boosting regression,” “ridge regression” and one “customized stack ensemble model” were used predict the sugarcane yield under two different datasets condition: integrated MODIS (Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) data with meteorological data and standalone meteorological data. Monthly mean value of eight MODIS data products, including “NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index),” “EVI (Enhanced vegetation index),” “GPP (Gross primary productivity),” “FPAR (Fraction of photosynthetically active radiation),” “LAI (Leaf area index),” “NDWI (Normalized difference water index),” “VCI (Vegetation condition index),” and “ET (Evapotranspiration),” were acquired over a 21 years period to be used as a feature in models. The classification accuracy of the sugarcane class was measured using the F1 score, which was 88.23%. The result revealed that alone meteorological data was not sufficient for accurate estimation of yield. However, a significant improvement in estimation accuracy was observed when meteorological data was integrated with MODIS data. Based on the accuracy metric, the stack ensemble model provided more prediction accuracy (RMSE of 2.01 t/ha) followed by XGB (RMSE of 3.81 t/ha), DT (RMSE of 4.36 t/ha), and RF (RMSE of 4.27 t/ha). Based on the feature important output provided by algorithms, features of FPAR, VCI, GPP, and Z41 (morning relative humidity) were found to be significant contributors to the prediction model.

The nutritional disorder in pears is either due to deficiency of nutrients or toxicity of nutrients. The techniques to identify the nutrients deficiencies include tissue testing, soil analysis, plant analysis, and visual deficiency symptoms. The effects of alfalfa greening, black end, and cork spot are minimised by correcting the calcium nutrition in the pear tree. In this paper, a two-class decision jungle model is proposed for the recognition of calcium deficiency in pears based on a non-invasive approach. The calcium deficiency in pears makes a bumpy fruit surface and leaves yellow color on the affected area than the rest of the skin results in the greyish corky lesion. The nutrient deficiency that results in serious disorders in pears not only influences the plant but also impacts the fruit quality. The introduction of artificial intelligence in the agriculture industry has helped farmers to produce healthier fruits. The artificial intelligence provides a real-time data for the classifier that results in increasing agricultural efficiencies, better crop yields and reduce fruit production costs by facilitating the routine and most complex tasks. The two-class decision jungle model achieves an accuracy of 98% with a database of 1000 samples. The other approaches, such as Boosted decision tree, Bayes point machine, Logistic regression, Neural Network, and SVM, have an accuracy of 92.20%, 84.3%, 72.5%, 82.4%, and 72.5%, respectively for the equivalent datasets. The highest accuracy is achieved with the proposed two class decision jungle that has non-linear decision boundaries and the performance is resilient in the presence of features that consist of noise. The number of calcium-deficient and healthy pears is 500 each. The geometrical features are extracted for the development of an artificial intelligence-based model for the classification of two classes like calcium deficient and healthy pear. The extracted features are split into training, validation, and testing. For training, validation, and testing, 80%, 10% and 10% samples are used respectively. The precision level is observed to be 0.974 and test accuracy is achieved as 98.7% and the overall accuracy 98% which are better than the existing 88.2% accuracy for pears using Support Vector Machine. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Calcium Deficiency; Image Classification; Machine Learning; Pear Nutrient Deficiency; Two Class Decision Jungle; Calcium; Decision Trees; Farms; Fruits; Logistic Regression; Nearest Neighbor Search; Nutrients; Nutrition; Plants (botany); Soil Testing; Statistical Tests; Support Vector Regression; Antioxidant Compounds; Calcium Deficiency; Calcium Deficients; Dietary Fibre; Dietary Plants; Images Classification; Machine-learning; Nutrient Deficiency; Pear Nutrient Deficiency; Two Class Decision Jungle; Image Classification,Calcium; Decision trees; Farms; Fruits; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Nutrients; Nutrition; Plants (botany); Soil testing; Statistical tests; Support vector regression; Antioxidant compounds; Calcium deficiency; Calcium deficients; Dietary fibre; Dietary plants; Images classification; Machine-learning; Nutrient deficiency; Pear nutrient deficiency; Two class decision jungle; Image classification,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001075020

Their inherent adaptability through RNA guides has fueled their application in therapeutics and diagnostics. These RNA-guided systems rely on specific targeting and interference by effectors. Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems depend on effector complexes composed of multiple subunits, whereas Class 2 systems employ single proteins with various functional domains for their effector function. The compact nature of Class 2 systems, particularly Cas9 nucleases, has revolutionized molecular biology and biotechnology due to their wide applicability in genome editing (GE). Beyond Cas9, computational analysis of genomes and metagenomes has revealed a vast diversity of Class 2 effector enzymes, including Cas12 and Cas13 variants. This expansion has led to the development of versatile molecular tools with distinct properties, including varied protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs), improved editing specificity, RNA targeting capabilities, smaller crRNAs, and diverse cleaving mechanisms. Notably, the promiscuous RNase activity of Cas13 enables highly sensitive nucleic acid detection. Expressing and delivering multi-protein Class 1 effectors pose significant challenges. The diverse array of CRISPR enzymes has significantly expanded the GE toolbox, enabling multiple applications from gene knockout to transcriptional modulation, and even RNA editing. The plant molecular biology and biotechnology toolkit powered by GE is constantly expanding due to advancements in rational design and the inherent versatility of CRISPR and related bacterial RNA-guided systems.

Plants expressing a version of NF-YA10 resistant to miR169 cleavage showed a perturbation in the LR gravitropic response. By extracting several features of root architecture using an improved version of the ChronoRoot deep-learning-based phenotyping system, we uncovered that these plants showed a differential angle of LRs over time when compared to Col-0. Detailed phenotyping of root growth dynamics revealed that NF-YA10 misregulation modulates the area explored by Arabidopsis roots.

Ensuring its health through the early detection and classification of diseases is essential in maximizing crop yields and productivity. While recent deep learning advancements, such as Vision Transformers, have shown promise in sugarcane disease classification, these methods often rely on resource-intensive models, limiting their practical applicability. This study introduces a novel stacking-based ensemble framework that combines embeddings from multiple state-of-the-art deep learning methods. It offers a lightweight and accurate approach for sugarcane disease classification. Leveraging the publicly available sugarcane leaf dataset, which includes 7134 high-resolution images across 11 classes (nine diseases, healthy leaves, and dried leaves), the proposed framework integrates embeddings from InceptionV3, SqueezeNet, and DeepLoc models with stacked ensemble classifiers. This approach addresses the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets and significantly enhances the classification performance.

This research addresses the imperative need for an advanced and integrated approach to mapping insect pest infestation in agricultural crops, utilising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multispectral (MS) imagery, and deep learning (DL). The existing literature reveals a limited number of studies that harness the potential of UAV-based MS imagery in conjunction with DL models for mapping and managing insect pest infestations. The primary aim is to enhance the precision and efficiency of insect pest infestation mapping through the synergistic analysis of spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and textural features using DL techniques. The aerial imagery and ground truth information were collected in crop field for mapping of insect pest infestation. The investigation comprised three specific analyses; first is about establishing correlations between insect pest pupal count versus spectral bands and VIs. Second, the performance comparison of three DL models including U-Net, DeepLabV3+, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to segment three classes including insect pest infestation patches, other vegetation (weeds), and crops. Finally, the third analysis evaluated the efficacy of textural features against spectral features in mapping an insect pest infestation using DL techniques. The results indicate that, concerning the correlation between pupal count in the field and spectral bands or VIs, the Simple Ratio Index (SRI), and Red Edge Chlorophyll Index (RECI) demonstrated a positive correlation of 0.7, whereas the Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI) displayed a positive correlation of 0.6. Another key finding shows that spectral features outperformed textural features across all DL models for insect pest infestation segmentation. The research highlights the effectiveness of spectral features, particularly with the FCN model, which demonstrated best performance metrics for insect pest segmentation in the study field. The FCN model achieved scores with a precision (P) of 93%, recall (R) of 97%, F1-score (F1) of 95%, and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90%, underscoring its excellence in accurately identifying and delineating pest infestations in the field. The proposed methodology and its findings offer implications such as enhanced pest surveillance, timely intervention, precision pest management, and optimised resource allocation that can be extended to optimise insect pest infestation mapping in various crop lands, enabling precise control strategies aimed at enhancing crop yield. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Drone; Soldier Fly; Sugarcane; Vegetation Index; Crop Yield; Fly; Machine Learning; Mapping; Multispectral Image; Pest Control; Precision Agriculture; Sugar Cane; Unmanned Vehicle; Vegetation Index,crop yield; fly; machine learning; mapping; multispectral image; pest control; precision agriculture; sugar cane; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217772281

However, its production is greatly affected by inter-annual climate variations in major production regions. While previous studies have assessed climate impacts on sugarcane yield at individual sites, a regional-scale understanding of the climate-yield relationship remains unclear. Here, we collected historical sugarcane yields (1980–2022) and meteorological data from 23 sites across Australia's eastern coastline sugarcane belt. Three statistical methods, random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting regression (XGBoost), and multiple linear regression (MLR), were used to assess the impacts of climatic factors on sugarcane yield. The results showed that the machine learning methods, particularly RF, outperformed MLR in estimating sugarcane yield. The RF model explained 45–62 % of yield variations in Australia's sugarcane regions based on climatic means and extreme climate indices. Growing season rainfall was identified as the most important factor influencing sugarcane yield in the Northern region, while CDD (consecutive dry days) was critical in the Central region, and TNn (minimum daily minimum temperature) was the dominant factor in the Southern region. Notably, the dominant factors exhibited a non-linear relationship with yield. In the Southern region, the lowest temperatures above 5 °C produced high yields. By contrast, in the Northern region, yields decreased with rainfall exceeding 1500 mm. Similarly, in the Central region, the increase in CDD substantially reduced yields, with yields reaching a low level after 70 days of CDD. To address these impacts, region-specific adaptation strategies are recommended, including the cultivation of waterlogging-tolerant crop varieties, the development of efficient irrigation systems, and the adoption of low-temperature-tolerant cultivars. This study highlights the critical importance of quantifying the contribution of climate variables to crop yield variability, thereby informing the development of effective, region-specific management practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Australia; Climate Variability; Extreme Climate Indices; Machine Learning; Sugarcane Yield; Annual Variation; Climate Change; Crop Yield; Cultivar; Extreme Event; Machine Learning; Sugar Cane; Australia,annual variation; climate change; crop yield; cultivar; extreme event; machine learning; sugar cane; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216216740

Predicting PDR protein is essential for understanding plant–pathogen interactions and developing strategies for crop protection. This study proposes a hybrid model for predicting and designing PDR proteins against plant-invading pathogens. Initially, we tried alignment-based approaches, such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) for similarity search and MERCI for motif search. These alignment-based approaches exhibit very poor coverage or sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, we developed alignment-free or machine learning (ML)-based methods using compositional features of proteins. Our ML-based model, developed using compositional features of proteins, achieved a maximum performance area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.91. The performance of our model improved significantly from AUROC of 0.91–0.95 when we used evolutionary information instead of protein sequence. Finally, we developed a hybrid or ensemble model that combined our best ML model with BLAST and obtained the highest AUROC of 0.98 on the validation dataset. We trained and tested our models on a training dataset and evaluated them on a validation dataset. None of the proteins in our validation dataset are more than 40% similar to proteins in the training dataset. One of the objectives of this study is to facilitate the scientific community working in plant biology.

However, due to the lack of an efficient genetic transformation system in Pst, progress in effector function studies has been slow. Here, we modeled the structures of 15,201 effectors from twelve Pst races or isolates, a Puccinia striiformis isolate, and one Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei isolate using AlphaFold2. Of these, 8,102 folds were successfully predicted, and we performed sequence- and structure-based annotations of these effectors. These effectors were classified into 410 structure clusters and 1,005 sequence clusters. Sequence lengths varied widely, with a concentration between 101-250 amino acids, and motif analysis revealed that 47% and 5.81% of the predicted effectors contain known effector motifs [Y/F/W]xC and RxLR, respectively highlighting the structural conservation across a substantial portion of the effectors. Subcellular localization predictions indicated a predominant cytoplasmic localization, with notable chloroplast and nuclear presence. Structure-guided analysis significantly enhances effector prediction efficiency as demonstrated by the 75% among 8,102 have structural annotation. The clustering and annotation prediction both based on the sequence and structure homologies allowed us to determine the adopted folding or fold families of the effectors. A common feature observed was the formation of structural homologies from different sequences. In our study, one of the comparative structural analyses revealed a new structure family with a core structure of four helices, including Pst27791, PstGSRE4, and PstSIE1, which target key wheat immune pathway proteins, impacting the host immune functions. Further comparative structural analysis showed similarities between Pst effectors and effectors from other pathogens, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50, Zt-KP4-1, and MoHrip2, highlighting a possibility of convergent evolutionary strategies, yet to be supported by further data encompassing on some evolutionarily distant species. Currently, our initial analysis is the most one on Pst effectors’ sequence, structural and annotation relationships providing a novel foundation to advance our future understanding of Pst pathogenicity and evolution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase; Glycosidase; Fungal Proteins; Origin 2022; Dynamic Response; Biological Functions; Classifieds; Computational Studies; Control Strategies; Genetic Transformation Systems; Puccinia Striiformis; Sequence Lengths; Stripe Rust; Structural Characterization; Structure-based; Immune System; Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase; Glycosidase; Proteome; Signal Peptide; Virulence Factor; Fungal Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Blumeria Graminis; Chloroplast; Effector Cell; Genetic Transformation; Machine Learning; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Melampsora Lini; Nonhuman; Pathogenicity; Phylogenetic Tree; Principal Component Analysis; Protein Database; Protein Motif; Protein Structure; Puccinia Striiformis F.

These diseases spread rapidly, impacting both leaf and fruit quality. Early detection is crucial for effective control measures. Recently, deep learning has proven to be a powerful tool in agriculture, enabling more accurate analysis and identification of crop diseases. This study applied the CRISP-DM methodology, consisting of six phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. A dataset of 900 banana leaf images was collected—300 of Black Sigatoka, 300 of Cordana, and 300 of healthy leaves. Three pre-trained models (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG19) were trained on this dataset. To improve performance, data augmentation techniques were applied using TensorFlow Keras’s ImageDataGenerator class, expanding the dataset to 9000 images. Due to the high computational demands of ResNet50 and VGG19, training was performed with EfficientNetB0. The models—EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG19—demonstrated the ability to identify leaf diseases in bananas, with accuracies of 88.33%, 88.90%, and 87.22%, respectively. The data augmentation increased the performance of EfficientNetB0 to 87.83%, but did not significantly improve its accuracy.

While using HLP tobacco as a sustainable fuel source is promising, it has not yet been tested for its tolerance to warmer environments that are expected in the near future as a result of climate change. We found that HLP tobacco had reduced stomatal conductance, which results in increased leaf temperatures up to 1.5°C higher under control and high temperature (38°C day/28°C night) conditions, reduced transpiration, and reduced CO<inf>2</inf> assimilation. We hypothesize this reduction in stomatal conductance is due to the presence of excessive, large lipid droplets in HLP guard cells imaged using confocal microscopy. High temperatures also significantly reduced total fatty acid levels by 55% in HLP plants; thus, additional engineering may be needed to maintain high titers of leaf oil under future climate conditions.

The cassava plant, the foremost producer of carbohydrates in the world, has emerged as a crucial energy source for those living in tropical areas. Yet, it was especially susceptible to bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, which hindered plant development and consequently the action. The major objective of this study is to assist farmers in swiftly identifying four different types of cassava plant disease before they cause serious harm to the plant community. The deep learning approach of the convolutional neural network, in particular, is widely applied in image recognition. models for identifying cassava plant diseases. Segmentation and filtering techniques are used in Convolutional neural networks for the proposed work. The suggested model has undergone testing and training using images of cassava plant disease. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the suggested model performs better and has a 99% accuracy rate. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cassava Plant Disease; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Machine Learning,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218946339

This study aimed to investigate the effects of two increasing concentrations of NPs (20 and 200 mg kg−1 of soil) in lettuce. To this aim, high-throughput hyperspectral imaging was combined with metabolomics, covering both primary (using NMR) and secondary metabolism (using LC-HRMS), along with lipidomics profiling (using ion-mobility-LC-HRMS) and plant performance. Hyperspectral imaging highlighted a reduced plant growth pattern. Several vegetative indexes indicated plant toxicity, with 20 mg kg−1 NPs significantly decreasing lettuce density and vegetation health (as indicated by NDVI and plant senescence reflectance indexes). Consistently, photosynthetic activity also decreased. At the biochemical level, metabolomics and lipidomics pointed out a multi-layered broad biochemical reprogramming of primary and secondary metabolism involving a decrease in sterols, sphingolipids, glycolipids, and glycerophospholipids in response to NPs. The reduction in phosphatidylinositol coincided with an accumulation of diacylglycerols (DAG), suggesting the activation of the phospholipase C lipid signaling pathway. Moreover, nanoplastic treatments down-modulated different biosynthetic pathways, particularly those involved in N-containing compounds and phenylpropanoids.

The efficient retrieval of large-scale field imagery combined with machine learning techniques shows success in various tasks like phenotyping, weeding, cropping, and disease control. This work will introduce a machine learning framework for automatized large-scale plant-specific trait annotation for the use case of disease severity scoring for CLS in sugar beet. With concepts of DLDL, special loss functions, and a tailored model architecture, we develop an efficient Vision Transformer based model for disease severity scoring called SugarViT. One novelty in this work is the combination of remote sensing data with environmental parameters of the experimental sites for disease severity prediction. Although the model is evaluated on this special use case, it is held as generic as possible to also be applicable to various image-based classification and regression tasks.

In recent decades, global temperature increases of over 2 °C above pre-industrial levels have impacted phenology, yield, sugar accumulation, and harvest time, ultimately affecting wine quality. Heat stress (> 35 °C) for 3–5 consecutive days from high temperatures and excessive solar radiation can disrupt the vine's physiology, prompting accelerated sugar accumulation in berries by 20–30%, a consequence of multiple factors including berry dehydration and high alcohol concentrations that compromise wine quality and typicity. Techniques such as late winter pruning, nanoparticle/antitranspirant application, netting (reducing solar radiation by 20–40%), training systems, and cluster thinning effectively reduce excessive fruit surface temperatures and modulate water loss, light exposure, and air circulation. Additionally, photo-selective shading can decrease berry cell death by 30–50%. Combining various methods can enhance yield and quality in hot, dry climates like the Mediterranean Basin by balancing the sink-source ratio. Adopting a holistic approach by combining traditional and modern techniques will aid viticulture in adapting to climate change. Hence, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) based sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's), and machine learning algorithms enables precise vineyard monitoring for irrigation and canopy status. Canopy management practices have evolved across centuries to optimize sunlight interception, photosynthetic capacity, and cluster zone microclimate, mitigating negative climate impacts. The choice of trellising in modern times has shifted from traditional, locally adapted methods towards more productive systems supported by fertigation and fungicides in the pursuit of increased yield. We suggest a holistic, microclimate/site-driven approach that integrates varietal biodiversity, precision irrigation, and sustainable soil management, which, even if not supported by AI-driven monitoring, can improve the balance between yield, quality, and vine resilience in a changing climate. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ai; Canopy Management; Climate Change; Global Warming; Grapevine; Trellising System; Wine Quality; Artificial Intelligence; Canopy Architecture; Climate Change; Crop Yield; Food Quality; Global Warming; Holistic Approach; Management Practice; Vine; Vineyard; Wine; Mediterranean Sea,artificial intelligence; canopy architecture; climate change; crop yield; food quality; global warming; holistic approach; management practice; vine; vineyard; wine; Mediterranean Sea,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216840577

Jujube fruits are abundant in polyphenolic secondary metabolites, particularly proanthocyanidins (PAs), which play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of jujube fruits. However, the mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of PAs remains unclear. The PA contents of sour jujube ‘Qingjiansuanzao’ and cultivated jujube ‘Junzao’ were compared at different developmental stages to unravel this mechanism. The PA contents of sour jujube were higher than that of cultivated jujube and decreased during fruit development. Combined with transcriptome analysis, a large number of differentially expressed genes related to PA biosynthesis were screened. Correlation analysis showed that ZjLAR and ZjANR played an active role in promoting the biosynthesis of PAs. Transient overexpression of ZjLAR and ZjANR in jujube fruits resulted in higher total PAs and monomeric catechin, but the PAs decreased after transient silencing. Overexpressing ZjLAR and ZjANR in Arabidopsis and tomato increased the content of PAs in Arabidopsis seeds and tomato fruits.

Current methods for rating Fusarium yellows disease severity rely on an ordinal scale, which limits precision for intermediate phenotypes. In this study, we aimed to improve the accuracy and precision of rating Fusarium yellows by developing a standard area diagram (SAD). Two SAD versions were created using images of sugar beets infected with Fusarium oxysporum strain F19. Each version was tested using inexperienced raters. Version 1 and the improved version 2 SAD showed no statistical differences in Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCC) values, which was used to assess accuracy and precision between the two versions (C<inf>b</inf> = 0.99 for both versions, (Formula presented.) <inf>c</inf> = 0.97 and 0.96 for version 1 and 2, respectively). In addition, five naïve Bayesian machine-learning models that used pixel classification to determine disease score were tested for congruency to human estimates in SAD version 2. Root mean square error was lowest compared to the ‘true’ values for the unweighted model and a model where necrotic tissue was given a 2× weight (12.4 and 12.6, respectively). The creation of this SAD enables breeding programmes to make consistent, accurate disease ratings regardless of personnel's previous experience with Fusarium yellows. Additionally, more iterations of pixel quantification equations may overcome accuracy issues for rating Fusarium yellows. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Disease Rating; Foliar Disease; Fusarium Commune; Fusarium Oxysporum; Fusarium Yellows; Vascular Wilt; Crop Yield; Disease Severity; Fungal Disease; Fungus; Genetic Analysis; Host Plant; Species Complex; Sugar Beet,crop yield; disease severity; fungal disease; fungus; genetic analysis; host plant; species complex; sugar beet,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208103944

The production rate and quality of cassava crops are affected by several diseases. However, the manual identification of diseases is challenging and requires considerable time because of the lack of field professionals and the limited availability of clear and distinct information. Consequently, the agricultural management system is seeking an efficient and lightweight method that can be deployable to edged devices for detecting diseases at an early stage. To address these issues and accurately categorize different diseases, a very effective and lightweight framework called CDDNet has been introduced. We used MobileNetV3Small framework as a backbone feature for extracting optimized, discriminating, and distinct features. These features are empirically validated at the early intermediate stage. Additionally, we modified the soft attention module to effectively prioritize the diseased regions and enhance significant cassava plant disease-related features for efficient cassava disease detection. RESULTS: Our proposed method achieved accuracies of 98.95%, 97.03%, and 98.25% on Cassava Image Dataset, Cassava Plant Disease Merged (2019–2020) Dataset, and the newly created Cassava Plant Composite Dataset, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed technique outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, parameter count, and frames per second values, ultimately making the proposed CDDNet the best one for real-time processing. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the importance of a lightweight and efficient technique for cassava disease detection and classification in a real-time environment. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of modified soft attention on model performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, a key obstacle involves the extraction of relevant spectral characteristics. This study aimed to enhance sugarcane disease recognition by combining convolutional neural network (CNN) with continuous wavelet transform (CWT) spectrograms for spectral features extraction within the Vis-NIR spectra (380–1400 nm) to improve the accuracy of sugarcane diseases recognition. Using 130 sugarcane leaf samples, the obtained one-dimensional CWT coefficients from Vis-NIR spectra were transformed into two-dimensional spectrograms. Employing CNN, spectrogram features were extracted and incorporated into decision tree, K-nearest neighbour, partial least squares discriminant analysis, and random forest (RF) calibration models. The RF model, integrating spectrogram-derived features, demonstrated the best performance with an average precision of 0.9111, sensitivity of 0.9733, specificity of 0.9791, and accuracy of 0.9487.

To address these issues, we propose PCLPAMP, a model incorporating prompt tuning and contrastive learning for plant AMP prediction. Continuous prompts guide the protein language model (LM) ProtT5 in extracting task-specific feature embeddings, while contrastive learning optimizes feature distribution to improve discrimination.

The southern region of Nariño in Colombia has a strong agricultural vocation. However, it has been identified that the technology associated with the recommendation of fertilization especially in microelements in the soil is limited, which generates conflicts in production. This situation demands a different and innovative approach to address these challenges. That is why this research uses the predictive capacity of the machine learning (ML) approach. Objective.

Although economically important, citrus crops like sweet orange, grapefruit, lemon, and mandarins face various diseases like canker, scab, and black spot, which lower fruit quality and yield. Traditional manual disease diagnosis is not only slow, less accurate, and expensive but also relies heavily on expert intervention. To address these issues, this research examines the implementation of an automated disease classification system using deep learning and optimal feature selection. The system incorporates data augmentation and transfer learning with pre-trained models such as DenseNet-201 and AlexNet to improve diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

To accurately and quickly predict citrus yield, this study obtained multispectral images of citrus fruit maturity through an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and extracted multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and texture features (T) from the images as feature variables. Extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gaussian process regression (GPR), and multiple stepwise regression (MSR) models were used to construct citrus fruit number and quality prediction models. The results show that, for fruit number prediction, the XGB model performed best under the combined input of VIs and T, with an R2 = 0.792 and an RMSE = 462 fruits. However, for fruit quality prediction, the RF model performed best when only the VIs were used, with an R2 = 0.787 and an RMSE = 20.0 kg. Although the model accuracy was acceptable, the number of input feature variables used was large. To further improve the model prediction performance, we explored a method that utilizes a hybrid coding particle swarm optimization algorithm (CPSO) coupled with XGB and SVM models. The coupled models had a significant improvement in predicting the number and quality of citrus fruits, especially the model of CPSO coupled with XGB (CPSO-XGB).

Consequently, the identification of abiotic stress-responsive genes (SRGs) in crops is essential for augmenting their resilience. This study presents a computational model utilizing machine learning techniques to predict genes in Chinese cabbage that respond to four abiotic stresses: cold, heat, drought, and salt. To construct this model, data from relevant studies regarding responses to these abiotic stresses were compiled, and the protein sequences encoded by abiotic SRGs were converted into numerical representations for subsequent analysis. For the selected feature set, six distinct machine learning binary classification algorithms were employed. The results demonstrate that the constructed models can effectively predict SRGs associated with the four types of abiotic stresses, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) for the models being 81.42%, 87.92%, 80.85%, and 88.87%, respectively. For each type of stress, a distinct number of stress-resistant genes was predicted, and the ten genes with the highest scores were selected for further analysis. To facilitate the implementation of the proposed strategy by users, an online prediction server, has been developed. This study provides new insights into computational approaches to the identification of abiotic SRGs in Chinese cabbage as well as in other plants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Binary Classification; Chinese Cabbage; Machine Learning; Stress-responsive Genes,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215989360

This study discusses the potential of active and passive remote sensing for SOC estimation modeling in agricultural areas, incorporating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (L-band quad-polarization and C-band dual-polarization), multi-spectrum (MS) data, and brightness temperature (TB) data. The performance of five advanced machine learning regression (MLR) models for SOC modeling was assessed, focusing on spatial interpolation accuracy and cross-spatial transfer accuracy, using two field observation datasets for modeling and validation. Results indicate that the SOC estimation accuracy when using MS data alone is comparable to that of using TB data alone, and both perform slightly better than SAR data. Radar cross-polarization ratio index, microwave polarization difference index, shortwave infrared reflectance, and soil parameters (elevation and soil moisture) demonstrate high correlation with the measured SOC. Incorporating temporal features, as opposed to single-phase features, allows each regression model to reach its upper limit of SOC estimation accuracy. The spatial interpolation accuracy of each MLR algorithm is satisfactory, with the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model demonstrating optimal modeling performance. When SAR, MS, or TB data are used individually in modeling, the estimation errors (RMSE) for SOC are 0.637 g/kg, 0.492 g/kg, and 0.229 g/kg for the SMAPVEX12 sampling campaign, and 0.706 g/kg, 0.454 g/kg, and 0.474 g/kg for the SMAPVEX16-MB sampling campaign, respectively. After incorporating soil moisture and topographic factors, the above RMSEs for SOC are further reduced by 57.8%, 35.6%, and 3.5% for the SMAPVEX12, and by 18.4%, 8.8%, and 3.4% for the SMAPVEX16-MB, respectively. However, cross-spatial transfer accuracy of the regression models remains limited (RMSE = 0.866–1.043 g/kg and 0.995–1.679 g/kg for different data sources). To address this, this study reduces uncertainties in SOC cross-spatial transfer by introducing terrain factors sensitive to SOC (RMSE = 0.457–0.516 g/kg and 0.799–1.198 g/kg for different data sources). The proposed SOC estimation and transfer framework, based on active and passive remote sensing data, provides guidance for high-resolution regional-scale SOC mapping and applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Brightness Temperature; Machine Learning Regression Model; Multi-spectrum; Soil Organic Carbon Estimation And Transfer; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Benchmarking; Fertilizers; Formal Concept Analysis; Image Segmentation; Image Thinning; Liquid Sugar; Radar Reflection; Regression Analysis; Time Difference Of Arrival; Active And Passive Remote Sensing; Brightness Temperatures; Carbon Estimations; Carbon Transfer; Machine Learning Regression Model; Machine-learning; Multi-spectrum; Regression Modelling; Soil Organic Carbon; Soil Organic Carbon Estimation And Transfer; Soil Moisture,Benchmarking; Fertilizers; Formal concept analysis; Image segmentation; Image thinning; Liquid sugar; Radar reflection; Regression analysis; Time difference of arrival; Active and passive remote sensing; Brightness temperatures; Carbon estimations; Carbon transfer; Machine learning regression model; Machine-learning; Multi-spectrum; Regression modelling; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon estimation and transfer; Soil moisture,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215817691

However, plant infectious diseases pay significant challenges in declining both the quality and yield. Another key factor limiting crop growth worldwide is a lack of essential nutrients. Deficiencies in macronutrients (P, N, Ca, Mg and K) and micronutrients (Cu, Zn, and Mo) have a major impact on plant growth and development, ultimately leading to plant death. However, with artificial intelligence (AI), it is now possible to detect not only symptoms, but also identify the specific pathogens, understand plant–pathogen interactions, and even analyse nutrient deficiencies in both soil and plants. Thus, AI is necessitated to address these issues, which allows for real-time, accurate analysis of plant health using robots and probes, making it faster and more precise than traditional methods of plant tissue and soil testing. Advanced AI techniques—such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—are now being applied to detect infectious diseases and nutrient levels.

Various biotechnological applications based on in vitro fertilization can benefit from better drug identification. For many nations, agriculture is the backbone of cancer medication development; increasing crop yields is the key to better drug identification in agricultural contexts. Computer vision applications suffer as a result of the efficient degradation of production quality and quantity caused by p-glycoprotein drugs used in cancer treatment. The identification of cancer-based p-glycoprotein drugs is an aggressive concept in the present day, due to the various symptoms present in cancer. Various authors use soft computing techniques and machine learning approaches to predict these drugs. For the purpose of automatically identifying based p-glycoprotein drugs in cancers, this paper proposes a Hybrid Novel Heuristic Model (HNHM) that combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) with Convolution neural networks (CNNs). The primary challenge in identifying cancer drugs based on p-glycoprotein is feature extraction; hence, dimensionality reduction is crucial in filtering out noise from the cancer sub-cancer drug dataset and separating the subset of the cancer drug dataset affected by the p-glycoprotein drug using support vector machines (SOM). It is a promising approach to automatically identify based p-glycoprotein drugs in cancers by exploring protein features in cancer and predicting which patches are affected by virus-bacteria. CNN is used to match cancer sub-cancer drug data sets. In this study, we use sub-Cancer drug data sets to develop a hybrid heuristic approach to identify based p-glycoprotein drugs found in cancers. Clinical trials of the suggested hybrid model were conducted using sub-cancer drug data sets derived from peach cancers and the publicly available Cancer's drug datasets housed in the UCI repository. With less training required to explore based on p-glycoprotein drugs from sub-Cancer drug datasets, the suggested hybrid model achieves an accuracy of nearly 99.93% when tested on different testing datasets for sub cancer drugs. When compared to other state-of-the-art methods, this one significantly reduces running time while providing efficient performance in a number of p-glycoprotein drug prediction metrics, including recall, sensitivity, and specificity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Drugs Derived From Fruits; Feature Extraction; Histograms; Prediction Of P-glycoprotein Drugs Based On Subsets Of The Population; Self-organizing Maps,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213356335

India is the second-largest producer of sugarcane in the world. However, sugarcane crops are highly affected by diseases, which significantly affect crop production. Despite development in deep learning techniques, disease detection remains a challenging and time-consuming task. This paper presents a novel Hybrid Shifted-Vision Transformer approach for the automated classification of sugarcane leaf diseases. The model integrates the Vision Transformer architecture with Hybrid Shifted Windows to effectively capture both local and global features, which is crucial for accurately identifying disease patterns at different spatial scales. To improve feature representation and model performance, self-supervised learning is employed using data augmentation techniques like random rotation, flipping, and occlusion, combined with a jigsaw puzzle task that helps the model learn spatial relationships in images. The method addresses class imbalances in the dataset through stratified sampling, ensuring balanced training and testing sets. The approach is fine-tuned on sugarcane leaf disease datasets using categorical cross-entropy loss, minimizing dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and real labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the Hybrid Shifted-Vision Transformer outperforms traditional models, achieving higher accuracy in disease detection of 98.5%, making it crucial for reliable disease diagnosis and decision-making in agriculture.

The pathogen secretes small proteinaceous effectors, virulence factors, inside the host to manipulate and perturb the host immune system, allowing the pathogen to colonize and establish a successful infection. While the molecular functions of several effectors are characterized, very little is known about the structural stability of these effectors. We analyzed a total of 554 small secretory proteins (SSPs) from the M. oryzae secretome to decipher key features of intrinsic disorder (ID) and the structural dynamics of the selected putative effectors through thorough and systematic in silico studies. Our results suggest that out of the total SSPs, 66% were predicted as effector proteins, released either into the apoplast or cytoplasm of the host cell. Of these, 68% were found to be intrinsically disordered effector proteins (IDEPs). Among the six distinct classes of disordered effectors, we observed peculiar relationships between the localization of several effectors in the apoplast or cytoplasm and the degree of disorder. We determined the degree of structural disorder and its impact on protein foldability across all the putative small secretory effector proteins from the blast pathogen, further validated by molecular dynamics simulation studies.

This paper focuses on physical, chemical, and biological factors that affect soil fertility since it is the foundation of agricultural yield. However, conventional soil testing techniques are tedious and do not offer any information that can be used in precision farming. To this end, this study aims to use logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors to predict the soil fertility levels from the critical soil parameters. The key advance is to use a wide set of soil parameters, including macro and micronutrients, and soil physico-chemical properties like pH, OC, and EC to build predictive models. The results show that using the random forest algorithm is more efficient than other models, with an accuracy of 99%, followed by decision trees at 98%.

To facilitate automatic and precise detection, this study leverages a deep learning approach combined with feature extraction techniques, namely Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for texture analysis and Hue, Saturation, Value (HSV) for color representation. The dataset utilized in this research comprises 17,146 tomato leaf images affected by various diseases. The classification process employs the Inception-ResNet-V2 architecture, a convolutional neural network known for its superior performance in image classification tasks. Initially, GLCM is applied to extract texture characteristics, while HSV is used to capture detailed color information. These extracted features are subsequently fed into the Inception-ResNet-V2 model, which is trained on the processed dataset. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize model performance. Experimental results indicate that integrating GLCM and HSV features with the Inception-ResNet-V2 model yields an accuracy of 98.65%.

In order to create a robust food security system that would facilitate efficient potato growing, potatoes - a staple item that is high in carbohydrates are given top priority. However, a number of diseases that affect potatoes hinder their development and cause problems for our entire agricultural supply chain. Therefore, a more efficient method of ensuring crop cultivation performance may be early disease identification. Our primary goal is to create a deep learning system that uses K-means clustering segmentation to identify and categorize potato leaf diseases. The VGG16, 2-D CNN, and ResNet50 network models are the ones we have chosen. Of these chosen models, we were able to obtain exceptional accuracy using VGG16, yielding the best result out of three networks.

The traditional method of detecting the disease involves inspecting it manually which takes a lot of time and effort. In recent years, a variety of deep learning techniques have proven to be a robust solution for plant disease classification with high accuracy in automated detection. We present a state-of-the-art deep learning-based technique that can classify 11 sugarcane leaf diseases using the Sugarcane Leaf Image Dataset. We are using the Xception model with transfer learning and fine-tuning. To improve generalization, data augmentation, class balancing, learning rate scheduling, and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) are used to train the model. The suggested model has a training accuracy of 99.29% and a validation accuracy of 97.80%. This shows it is effective in classifying diseases. Also, a GUI application is developed using Tkinter, which would assist in classifying the sugarcane leaves image in real time. This research shows how deep learning can change the way we control diseases in sugarcanes. This can offer a solution that can be done at scale, effectively, and with high technology.

The proposed model was developed to effectively identify and classify different types of sheets of sheets, such as oxide, red scratches and mosaic diseases, incorporating damping techniques to reduce noise and improve characteristic extraction.

Pepper is also an essential ingredient in many meals, adding a distinct taste and color. The main motive for doing this work is to take care of these plants and reveal the diseases they infect using two different algorithms and compare them. The first algorithm, the support vector machine, was employed for classification after multiple processing steps on plant leaves. The second algorithm is the convolution neural network, which consists of several layers built to detect diseases in plant leaves. Five classes have been classified in the two mentioned algorithms. Three are categories for potatoes and two categories for peppers. The comparison result was that the convolution neural network algorithm outperformed in accuracy and performance. In the convolution neural network algorithm, we obtained an overall accuracy rate in training (99.90) and testing (96.10).

Traditional breeding faces challenges such as polyploidy, high level of genomic heterogeneity, and complex gene-trait associations. By combining multi-omics data researchers learn more about the genetic and molecular basis of important agricultural traits. However, statistical methods are often insufficient to address the data complexity. By contrast, AI techniques, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), are emerging as powerful tools to explore complexity. Algorithms such as random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) can support genomic selection (GS) and trait value prediction. Furthermore, DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) dominate high-throughput phenotyping and time series analyses, providing accurate predictions for crop yield, disease resistance, and genotype adaptation. Large language models (LLMs) are able to integrate complex omics data. AI models can analyze large dataset, generated by genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomic applications because algorithms can combine different inputs, such as DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, protein–protein interaction networks, metabolite concentrations, and phenotypic data under specific environmental conditions. The integration of individual models can improve prediction accuracy by reducing resource inputs and automating labor-intensive tasks involved in breeding programs. Some recent AI methods, such as gradient boosting machines (GBMs) and Transformer models, are increasingly being used to improve scalability and accuracy of predictive analytics.

These are abundant sources of vitamins C, potassium, B6, dietary fibre, and carbohydrates that make them important food sources among the majority of the population. However, potato production is often hampered by diseases such as early and late blight, which can significantly reduce their yield. Artificial intelligence (AI)–driven deep learning models are redefining the agriculture sector, particularly through the timely diagnosis and management of leaf diseases. These models can examine the patterns and abnormalities in potato leaf images to detect diseases early, helping farmers to respond promptly to curb crop losses. In this study, we introduced a convolutional neural network-based model, PotConvNet, which was trained and tested on two different potato leaf datasets, labelled as Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 to detect potato foliar disease. The suggested PotConvNet demonstrated a high classification accuracy of 99.76% and 97.78% for Potato Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, respectively.

In general, rice serves as an excellent energy source based on its carbohydrate content that provides a significant amount of calories, and is the central component of daily meals. Also, rice contains high caloric food content, which provides adequate protein, less fat, and other minerals. Various factors, including soil quality, weather conditions, insects, viruses, pathogens, and temperature, affect rice quality. Earlier researchers have shown that plant disease has a big effect on rice crops, which leads to continuous financial loss in the agricultural sector. Pytopathologists are pursuing reliable and effective techniques for accurately diagnosing and managing disease-affected rice plants. Farmers utilize a classical disease recognition methodology that consumes more time for visual inspection, resulting in huge economic losses. The evolution in agricultural technology helps to detect pathogenic organisms in rice plants and also controls the disease significantly using deep learning models that show remarkable attention in the research of crop disease. However, deep learning techniques like CNN, RCNN, Mask-RCNN, and C-GAN models have emerged for detecting the disease in plants. Limits in data samples and the small size of affected regions in the deep learning models can gradually decrease the detection performance. Due to complex conditions and changes in resolution size, the consideration of existing techniques fails to provide accurate detection outcomes. So, this work uses the hybrid deep learning model to solve traditional problems. At first, the required images are gathered from the Paddy Doctor: Paddy Disease Classification dataset and given to the segmentation phase. The multipath refinement network with region attention mechanism (MRNet-RAM) is developed to perform the segmentation process. Further, the images are entered into the classification using the optimized hybrid network (OHyNet), where the hybrid model comprises a pyramidal dilated DenseNet with an efficient capsule network. Moreover, to improve the classification accuracy, significant parameters are optimized in the OHyNet using the fitness divisible value of the dung beetle optimizer (FDVDO). Finally, the suggested system attains effective leaf disease classification outcomes. Then, the efficiency of the recommended technique is compared and evaluated with an existing model to showcase its superiority over others. From the simulation outcomes, the performance examination of the designed framework shows 94.52%, 94.54%, and 65.7% regarding accuracy, precision, and recall, respectively. The advancement of the simulation outcome helps the farmers to detect rice leaf disease promptly. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Efficient Capsule Network, Fitness Divisible Value Of Dung Beetle Optimizer (fdvdo); Multipath Refinement Network With Region Attention Mechanism (mrnet-ram); Optimized Hybrid Network (ohynet); Pyramidal Dilated Densenet; Rice Leaf Disease Diagnosis; Agricultural Economics; Agricultural Technology; Complex Networks; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Cultivation; Deep Learning; Disease Control; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Losses; Plant Diseases; Plants (botany); Attention Mechanisms; Disease Diagnosis; Dung Beetles; Efficient Capsule Network, Fitness Divisible Value Of Dung Beetle Optimizer; Hybrid Network; Leaf Disease; Multipath; Multipath Refinement Network With Region Attention Mechanism; Optimized Hybrid Network; Optimizers; Pyramidal Dilated Densenet; Rice Leaf Disease Diagnose; Rice Leaves; Crops","Agricultural economics; Agricultural technology; Complex networks; Computer aided diagnosis; Cultivation; Deep learning; Disease control; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Losses; Plant diseases; Plants (botany); Attention mechanisms; Disease diagnosis; Dung beetles; Efficient capsule network, fitness divisible value of dung beetle optimizer; Hybrid network; Leaf disease; Multipath; Multipath refinement network with region attention mechanism; Optimized hybrid network; Optimizers; Pyramidal dilated densenet; Rice leaf disease diagnose; Rice leaves; Crops",Article,aip,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009533293

Here, we aimed to identify a synergistic herb pair against TNBC by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) and a multiscale interactome. We curated TNBC-related biomarkers and constructed an herb–compound–target–disease network by integrating multiple data sources. Using this dataset, we trained and evaluated three GNN architectures—graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network, and graph sample-and-aggregate (GraphSAGE)—on 6830 herb pairs annotated with compound and target information. We then applied a biased random walk algorithm to estimate the network effect of herb targets and TNBC-related proteins, identifying new herbal candidates with potential synergy. Among the tested GNNs, GraphSAGE showed the highest performance in distinguishing known versus unknown herb pairs, with significant accuracy gains (p < 0.001). We subsequently performed diffusion profile analysis on top-ranked herbal combinations, revealing key TNBC targets, such as AKT1 and TP53. This multiscale approach illuminated potential synergistic effects within herbal therapies for TNBC. Our findings demonstrate that integrating GNN-driven deep learning with network pharmacology can systematically uncover multi-target herbal therapies for TNBC. Moreover, the molecular network we present can guide the design of materials for the rapid screening of herb–target interactions, aligning this work with emerging sensing technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Graph Neural Network; Graphsage; Multiscale Interactome; Network Pharmacology; Synergistic Herbal Therapies; Triple-negative Breast Cancer; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Graph Neural Networks; Oncology; Plant Diseases; Plant Extracts; Graph Sample-and-aggregate; Herb Pairs; Interactome; Multiscale Interactome; Network Pharmacologies; Networks/graphs; Relapse Rates; Synergistic Herbal Therapy; Triple-negative Breast Cancers; Diseases,Deep learning; Diagnosis; Graph neural networks; Oncology; Plant diseases; Plant extracts; Graph sample-and-aggregate; Herb pairs; Interactome; Multiscale interactome; Network pharmacologies; Networks/graphs; Relapse rates; Synergistic herbal therapy; Triple-negative breast cancers; Diseases,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009444472

Secreted microbial signaling molecules initiate and mediate symbiosis by binding to structurally compatible plant receptors. For example, lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), produced by nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria and various fungi, are recognized by plant lysin motif receptor-like kinases (LysM-RLKs), which activate the common symbiotic pathway. Accurately predicting these molecular interactions could reveal complementary signatures underlying the initial stages of endosymbiosis. Despite the breakthrough in protein-ligand structure prediction with deep learning-based tools, such as AlphaFold3, the large size and highly flexible nature of signaling compounds like LCOs present major challenges for detailed structural characterization and binding-affinity prediction. Typical structure-/physics-based methods of ligand virtual screening are designed for small, drug-like molecules, often rely on high-resolution, experimentally determined structures of the protein receptors, and rarely achieve sufficient sampling to obtain converged thermodynamic quantities with large ligands. In this study, we developed a hybrid molecular dynamics/machine learning (MD/ML) approach capable of predicting binding affinity rankings with high accuracy in systems involving large, flexible ligands, despite limited experimental structural information. Using coarse initial structural models, the predictions using the MD/ML workflow achieved strong alignment with experimental trends, particularly in the top-affinity tier for four legume LysM-RLKs (LYR3) binding to LCOs and a chitooligosaccharide. Furthermore, the MD-based conformation selection protocol provided critical structural insights into substrate specificity and binding mechanisms. This study demonstrates a powerful method to screen for challenging cognate ligand-receptors and advance our understanding of the molecular basis of microbial colonization in plants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Lipo-chitooligosaccharides; Lysm; Machine Learning; Plant-microbe Interactions; Protein-ligand Binding Affinity Prediction; Signaling Molecules; Nitrogen; Phosphotransferase; Bacteria; Binding Energy; Biochemistry; Biological Membranes; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Molecular Dynamics; Plant Diseases; Plants (botany); Binding Affinities; Chitooligosaccharides; Lipo-chitooligosaccharide; Lysm; Machine-learning; Plant-microbe Interactions; Protein-ligand Binding Affinities; Protein-ligand Binding Affinity Prediction; Receptor-like Kinase; Signaling Molecules; Learning Systems; Ligands; Ligand; Nitrogen; Oligosaccharide; Phosphotransferase; Receptor; Article; Binding Affinity; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Endosymbiosis; Enzyme Specificity; Ligand Binding; Machine Learning; Microbial Colonization; Molecular Dynamics; Molecular Interaction; Nonhuman; Plant Microorganism Interaction; Rhizobiales; Signal Transduction; Structural Model; Structure Analysis; Symbiosis; Thermodynamics,Bacteria; Binding energy; Biochemistry; Biological membranes; Deep learning; Forecasting; Molecular dynamics; Plant diseases; Plants (botany); Binding affinities; Chitooligosaccharides; Lipo-chitooligosaccharide; Lysm; Machine-learning; Plant-microbe interactions; Protein-ligand binding affinities; Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction; Receptor-like kinase; Signaling molecules; Learning systems; Ligands; ligand; nitrogen; oligosaccharide; phosphotransferase; receptor; Article; binding affinity; controlled study; deep learning; endosymbiosis; enzyme specificity; ligand binding; machine learning; microbial colonization; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; nonhuman; plant microorganism interaction; Rhizobiales; signal transduction; structural model; structure analysis; symbiosis; thermodynamics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009288836

Multiple regression models were developed and evaluated using a comprehensive dataset containing Brix values, cane juice weights, Pol values, reducing sugar content, non-sugar content, water content, water type, soil type, ratoon type, season, and cane variety. After rigorous evaluation and hyperparameter optimization, the Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance with a coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.9503 ), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE = 3.13), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE = 1.63). The feature importance results highlighted a clear hierarchy in predictor significance, with water content and Brix values collectively driving approximately 90% of the model’s predictive strength. These two variables substantially outweighed all other factors in determining the model outcomes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on proxy measures that require subsequent calculations and technical interpretation, this direct prediction methodology provides an immediate, actionable metric for all stakeholders. This data-driven alternative to laboratory-based assessment methods enables jaggery manufacturers and sugarcane growers to make informed decisions regarding crop selection, harvesting time, pricing, and processing strategies based on predicted sugar yields. The proposed model has the potential to significantly reduce economic losses, improve product quality, and enhance sustainability in the sugarcane value chain.

Accurate and efficient detection of diseased regions is essential for effective disease management. Two CNN models were designed and integrated in this study for pixel-level disease segmentation: the first classified regions as asymptomatic, huanglongbing (HLB), or zinc-deficient, while the second, still under development, aims to refine classification across seven categories: asymptomatic, HLB, canker, melanose, scab, zinc-deficient, and greasy spot. The first CNN was tested with various spectral band configurations. The model using all 100 bands achieved the highest accuracy, with 98% for asymptomatic regions, 88% for HLB, and 92% for zinc-deficient regions. Models with uniformly spaced 10-band and PCA-selected 10- and 15-band configurations performed comparably, with minimal accuracy loss. Notably, the PCA-selected 15-band model achieved accuracy close to that of the 100-band model. The model with PCA-selected 15-band exhibited increased misclassification for asymptomatic samples, with 2% labeled as HLB and 2% as zinc-deficient, compared to 1% in the Uniform100 model. Misclassification of HLB as zinc-deficient rose from 4% to 5%, while its misclassification as asymptomatic remained constant at 8%. Zinc-deficient samples showed unchanged error rates, with 3% mislabeled as asymptomatic and 5% as HLB. Overall, the model with PCA-selected 15-band introduced minor shifts in error patterns, primarily increasing confusion between asymptomatic and diseased regions.

Guava (Psidium guajava) is a highly regarded fruit for its nutritional benefits, including high levels of dietary fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins A and C. Nevertheless, guava cultivation is encountering substantial obstacles due to various leaf diseases, which can harm the quality of the fruit and the yield. It is imperative to effectively manage these diseases to guarantee the optimal fruit production and guava crops' health. Timely and precise disease identification is critical to conventional disease management strategies, including applying fungicides, cultivating resistant varieties, and implementing cultural practices. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), present promising solutions for the automated detection and classification of plant diseases based on visual symptoms. A CNN model that is specifically designed for the classification of guava leaf diseases, such as Canker, Dot, Mummification, Rust, and Healthy leaves, is proposed in this study. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset that included 2108 training images and 527 testing images, and it was subsequently evaluated over a period of 30 epochs. It achieved an overall accuracy of 86.91%, with high precision, recall, and F1 scores across various disease categories. The model's potential for practical applications in agriculture, such as mobile apps or field-based systems, to assist farmers in the timely and effective management of diseases is evident in its robustness and reliability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Guava Leaf Disease Image Classification; Yeast; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Dietary Fibre; Domestic Consumption; Global Trade; Images Classification; Leaf Disease; Nutritional Benefits; Psidium Guajava; Psidium Guajava Leaf Disease Image Classification; Fruits,Yeast; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Dietary fibre; Domestic consumption; Global trade; Images classification; Leaf disease; Nutritional benefits; Psidium guajava; Psidium guajava leaf disease image classification; Fruits,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007436669

This work falls under the broad research area of how certain environmental factors in the context of rainfall, temperature; affects the use of fertilizer and macronutrient, thereby affecting crop yield. Because agricultural systems are diverse and dynamic, there is a clear need to incorporate these strong analysis methods to aid with making better predictions concerning yields, as well as farming practices in the future. In the current study, the density estimation techniques and analysis clearly indicated bimodal distribution of the selected input variables thus revealing the presence of two different crops within the data set. One crop type is less annual water demand type that prefers 400-500 mm rainfall and 25-30oC temperature whereas the other crop type demands heavier more than 1100 mm rainfall and 35-40oC temperature. The investigation also described the means yield relation, and it depicted that there is a simple relationship between yield and nutrient concentration though it also indicated high coefficient of variation emphasized effect of other factors such as type of soil, climate, variety of crops. When it comes to quantitative prediction of crops, algorithms like Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor are utilized as and when possible. Random Forest Regressor thus seems to be a better option than Decision Tree Regressor due to reasons of accuracy and the potential to handle non-linear data. The results reiterate that agricultural productivity is not a unidimensional one, it is a multifaceted construct and there is a clear need to identify more predictors of yield. The research is useful in extending knowledge on the factors that determine the crop yield. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Inputs; Agriculture Environment; Bimodal Distribution; Complex Machine Learning Algorithms; Decision Tree Regression Model; Eda; Key Yield Components; Modality; Random Forest Regression Model; Yield; Yield Predictions,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007207927

Machine learning technology has the potential to greatly improve agriculture by helping farmers make more educated decisions. However, current systems have considerable limitations. Many fertilizer recommendations only address the key nutrients NPK: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, fail to account for water availability, and rely on out-of-date historical data. This study would close these gaps by producing a machine learning system that can help farmers with crop recommendations, fertiliser guidance, and plant disease detection. The algorithm considers micronutrients and organic matter in addition to NPK when recommending fertiliser. It also incorporates water availability and real-time meteorological data to provide more precise crop suggestions, especially important for drought-prone areas. Deep learning methods analyze plant photos to detect diseases early on. Our findings indicate that by incorporating micro nutrients, water data, and real-time climate updates, the system can deliver more precise crop and fertilizer recommendations. The Random Forest and XGBoost models outperform, and the disease detection component helps to prevent crop losses by intervening early. The key takeaway from this study is that merging machine learning with large amounts of data can significantly improve farming techniques, raise crop yields, and provide farmers with reliable insights, thereby enhancing food security and sustainable agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop And Fertilizer Recommendation; Machine Learning; Plant Disease Detection; Random Forest; Real Time Data; Xgboost Model; Agricultural Robots; Combines; Global Warming; Harvesters; Reforestation; Seed; Crop And Fertilizer Recommendation; Disease Detection; Machine-learning; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Detection; Random Forests; Real- Time; Real-time Data; Water Availability; Xgboost Model; Deep Learning,Agricultural robots; Combines; Global warming; Harvesters; Reforestation; Seed; Crop and fertilizer recommendation; Disease detection; Machine-learning; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Random forests; Real- time; Real-time data; Water availability; Xgboost model; Deep learning,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006460933

Guava farms across various regions provide images of guava leaves, both healthy and diseased, to train a deep learning model for disease classification. The EfficientNet-B3 model, optimized with Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Transfer Learning, is used for accurate disease detection, including conditions like Anthracnose and Powdery Mildew. To ensure privacy, Federated Learning (FL) is employed, where the model is trained locally on edge devices such as smartphones and Jetson Nano devices situated at guava farms. These devices process the data locally and send model updates, rather than raw data, to a central server. This method enables the aggregation of knowledge from multiple farms without sharing sensitive information, thereby protecting farmers' data privacy. The use of Federated Learning allows the model to adapt to specific conditions at each farm, such as different diseases, leaf appearances, and lighting variations, improving its robustness and accuracy. Additionally, AWS IoT integration allows real-time monitoring and alerts, further empowering farmers with timely disease detection.

However, a significant quantity of crop loss occurs every year due to stresses. To manage this, there is different research going on for plants such as stress analysis, phenotyping, genetic improvement, nutrient & mineral deficiency and toxicity analysis, weeds protection, insect control analysis, etc. For stress analysis, different types of sensors are used for plant data collection such as temperature, humidity, camera, spectral camera, etc. The visible range is widely utilized due to camera sensor availability, but it has limitations that images can be collected for analysis only when symptoms are visible. However, another non-visible spectrum (Thermal Infrared) is becoming more useful, as it can provide plant insight information before symptoms are visible. Infrared spectrum is used for disease analysis and is able to predict disease in the presymptomatic stage before the appearance of disease symptoms in the visible spectrum. Thermal infrared imaging is utilized for machine and deep learning models for disease identification. Further, combining thermal infrared imaging with RGB imaging provides more information for disease analysis in the real field.

Its versatility makes it an essential crop for industries seeking sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. This study presents an advanced approach that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically a multilayer perceptron model, to accurately estimate sugarcane productivity and biomass. The model incorporates the effects of micronutrient applications, both in the planting furrow and on the leaves, effectively capturing the complex interactions that influence crop yield. During training, the ANN demonstrated high precision, achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.000097 and an R2 of 0.98, closely aligning the predicted outputs with experimental results. In the validation phase, using previously unseen data, it maintained strong performance, with an MSE of 0.0008796. This performance supports the model’s ability to generalize beyond the training set, reliably estimating sugarcane yield and biomass under varying conditions.

It provides essential nutrients such as fiber, potassium, and magnesium that contribute to overall health. Coconut leaf disease (CLD) poses a significant threat to coconut production worldwide, requiring efficient and accurate detection methods. To overcome these challenges, a novel deep learning-based CODE-MNET model has been proposed for classifying the CLD. Initially, the dataset was gathered from coconut farms in the Chennai region of Tamil Nadu and the collected image of a coconut leaf is taken as a test image to analyse whether it is healthy or diseased. The gathered images are pre-processed using a gaussian filter for eliminating the noise artifacts and adjusting the image size to make it uniform for analysis. To increase the diversity of training data by utilizing random transformations such as rotating, flipping to generate additional variations of the original image. An important color feature can be extracted from the pre-processed image by using MobileNet. Then, the extracted features are fed into various machine learning (ML) algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify the image as either healthy or diseased. The classification accuracy of 98.81% for the proposed SVM is highly reliable for publicly available dataset.

This study also conducts a comparative analysis of various state-of-the-art models, evaluating their training time, parameters, accuracy and model size using the same dataset. Based on this evaluation, the optimal model was selected for final evaluation. Several pre-trained models were modified to enhance speed and reduce storage requirements. The system can identify the disease category for every given sugarcane leaf image using the EfficientNetB0 model, which demonstrated the best performance, and also provides the probability of correct identification. Several preprocessing steps are involved such as removing noise, addressing missing data, and standardizing images to ensure maximum accuracy. The models were trained, validated, and tested on a dataset of 4,800 sugarcane leaf images from the Sugarcane Leaf Disease Dataset. Among all the models, EfficienNetB0, InceptionV3 and ResNet50 achieved high accuracy (98.75%, 98.54% and 98.54%, respectively).

This study delves into the development and application of a CNN model built using TensorFIow to classify a variety of plant leaf diseases. By leveraging an extensive dataset containing images of both healthy and diseased leaves, the model is trained to accurately recognize and distinguish between several disease types. This approach not only automates the process of disease identification but also significantly improves diagnostic precision and speed, enabling swift and targeted interventions. Experimental findings reveal the CNN model's effectiveness, achieving notable improvements over traditional image processing methods. This research highlights the potential for incorporating deep learning methods into agricultural practices, paving the way for more intelligent and resilient crop management systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bacterial Count; Dairy Farming; Fat Content; Machine Learning; Milk Quality; Predictive Models; Protein Levels; Sustainability; Convolutional Neural Networks; Bacterial Count; Convolutional Neural Network; Dairy Farming; Fat Contents; Leaf Disease; Machine-learning; Milk Quality; Plant Leaves; Predictive Models; Protein Level,Convolutional neural networks; Bacterial count; Convolutional neural network; Dairy farming; Fat contents; Leaf disease; Machine-learning; Milk quality; Plant leaves; Predictive models; Protein level,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000012735

As MPs accumulate in terrestrial environments, their potential impact on plant health and agricultural productivity has become a growing area of focus. This study presents a comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating the effects of MPs on plant physiological and biochemical parameters, synthesizing data from 37 studies comprising 2886 observations. Our findings indicate that MPs significantly decrease plant biomass by 13 % (95 % CI: 7–19 %) and chlorophyll content by 28 % (95 % CI: 23–34 %), impairing crop growth and quality. Notably, higher doses and smaller MP particle sizes exert more pronounced inhibitory effects, particularly on root activity and biomass, while larger MPs predominantly damage plant roots. Furthermore, MPs were found to significantly increase oxidative stress in plants, evidenced by a 20 % rise in oxidative damage (95 % CI: 15–25 %) and a 14 % increase in antioxidant capacity (95 % CI: 8–19 %). This study highlights intricate interactions between MP type, particle size, dose, and plant species, with particle size having a greater impact than dose. This study emphasizes the importance of accounting for crop diversity and environmental factors to fully elucidate the potential risks posed by MP pollution to agricultural ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop Diversity; Dose-response; Microplastics; Plant Biochemical Traits; Catalase; Chlorophyll; Malonaldehyde; Nitrogen; Superoxide Dismutase; Microplastics; Soil Pollutants; Biotic; Agricultural Ecosystems; Biochemical Traits; Crop Diversity; Dose Response; Meta-analysis; Microplastics; Particles Sizes; Plant Biochemical Trait; Plant Physiology; Plastic Pollutions; Plant Diseases; Antioxidant; Catalase; Chlorophyll; Malonaldehyde; Microplastic; Nitrogen; Superoxide Dismutase; Agricultural Ecosystem; Biochemistry; Dose-response Relationship; Experimental Study; Inhibition; Meta-analysis; Oxidative Stress; Particle Size; Physiological Response; Plant; Plastic Waste; Pollution Effect; Pollution Exposure; Agroecosystem; Aquatic Environment; Asteraceae; Biochemical Parameters; Chlorophyll Content; Crop; Enzyme Activity; Fabaceae; Lipid Peroxidation; Machine Learning; Meta Analysis; Microbial Community; Nonhuman; Parameters; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Plant Growth; Plant Height; Plant Physiology; Prevalence; Public Health; Review; Root Growth; Soil Fertility; Soil Microflora; Species Richness; Agriculture; Drug Effect; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Soil Pollutant; Toxicity; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Soil Pollutants","Biotic; Agricultural ecosystems; Biochemical traits; Crop diversity; Dose response; Meta-analysis; Microplastics; Particles sizes; Plant biochemical trait; Plant physiology; Plastic pollutions; Plant diseases; antioxidant; catalase; chlorophyll; malonaldehyde; microplastic; nitrogen; superoxide dismutase; agricultural ecosystem; biochemistry; dose-response relationship; experimental study; inhibition; meta-analysis; oxidative stress; particle size; physiological response; plant; plastic waste; pollution effect; pollution exposure; agroecosystem; aquatic environment; Asteraceae; biochemical parameters; chlorophyll content; crop; enzyme activity; Fabaceae; lipid peroxidation; machine learning; meta analysis; microbial community; nonhuman; parameters; photosynthesis; physiology; plant growth; plant height; plant physiology; prevalence; public health; Review; root growth; soil fertility; soil microflora; species richness; agriculture; drug effect; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; soil pollutant; toxicity; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Soil Pollutants",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207576806

However, studies on the phytotoxicity of MNPs and PCBs on primary producers are limited. This study investigated the effects of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs, 10 mg/L) and 2,2′,5,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB-52, 0.1 mg/L), on the growth of Spirodela polyrhiza and Salvinia natans, and their impact on plant competitive ability under co-culture conditions. Laser confocal microscopy images revealed that PS-NPs accumulated on the leaf and root surfaces of both species. Combined exposure to PS-NPs and PCB-52 significantly inhibited the average specific and relative growth rates (RGR) of both species, reduced chlorophyll a and b levels, and slightly increased carotenoid content, disrupting the photosynthetic system. PCB-52 exacerbated PS-NPs accumulation on plants, leading to increased hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) and superoxide anion (O<inf>2</inf>[rad]−) production in both roots and leaves. This affects the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the soluble protein content. The combined treatment with PS-NPs and PCB-52 induced greater ecological stress in both species than the treatment with PS-NPs alone. In addition, the combined treatment with PS-NPs and PCB-52 significantly improved the relative yield and competition balance index of S. polyrhiza, indicating that PS-NPs + PCB-52 enhanced the competitive ability of S. polyrhiza when co-cultured with S. natans. This study confirmed the effects of co-exposure to PS-NPs and PCB-52 on aquatic plant growth and species competition, contributing to better insight into the ecological impacts of MNPs and organic pollutants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aquatic Plants; Competitiveness; Nanoplastics; Phytotoxicity; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Chlorophyll A; Chlorophyll B; Hydrogen Peroxide; Malonaldehyde; Peroxidase; Polystyrene; Superoxide; Superoxide Dismutase; Microplastics; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polystyrenes; Hydrogen Peroxide; Plant Diseases; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Aquatic Plants; Co-cultures; Combined Treatment; Competitive Ability; Competitiveness; Microplastics; Nanoplastics; Phytotoxicity; Potential Threats; Spirodela Polyrhiza; Superoxide Dismutase; 2,2,5,5 Tetrachlorobiphenyl; Carotenoid; Chlorophyll A; Chlorophyll B; Hydrogen Peroxide; Malonaldehyde; Nanoplastic; Peroxidase; Polychlorinated Biphenyl; Polystyrene; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Superoxide; Superoxide Dismutase; Unclassified Drug; Microplastic; Polystyrene Derivative; Aquatic Plant; Competition (ecology); Ecological Impact; Enzyme Activity; Growth Rate; Microscopy; Organic Pollutant; Pcb; Photosynthesis; Phytotoxicity; Plastic Waste; Polymer; Protein; Abiotic Stress; Article; Coculture; Community Structure; Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy; Confocal Microscopy; Environmental Risk; Image Processing; Lipid Peroxidation; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Protein Analysis; Protein Content; Salvinia Natans; Araceae; Drug Effect; Fern; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Coculture Techniques; Ferns; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polystyrenes","Hydrogen peroxide; Plant diseases; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Aquatic plants; Co-cultures; Combined treatment; Competitive ability; Competitiveness; Microplastics; Nanoplastics; Phytotoxicity; Potential threats; Spirodela polyrhiza; Superoxide dismutase; 2,2,5,5 tetrachlorobiphenyl; carotenoid; chlorophyll a; chlorophyll b; hydrogen peroxide; malonaldehyde; nanoplastic; peroxidase; polychlorinated biphenyl; polystyrene; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; microplastic; polystyrene derivative; aquatic plant; competition (ecology); ecological impact; enzyme activity; growth rate; microscopy; organic pollutant; PCB; photosynthesis; phytotoxicity; plastic waste; polymer; protein; abiotic stress; Article; coculture; community structure; confocal laser scanning microscopy; confocal microscopy; environmental risk; image processing; lipid peroxidation; plant growth; plant leaf; protein analysis; protein content; Salvinia natans; Araceae; drug effect; fern; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Coculture Techniques; Ferns; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polystyrenes",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206531232

Techniques such as visualization of native fluorescence, fluorescent protein tagging of microbes, green fluorescent protein (GFP)/red fluorescent protein (RFP)-fusion proteins, and fluorescent labeling of plant and fungal proteins have been widely used to aid in these investigations. Use of fluorescent proteins has several pitfalls, including variability of expression in planta and the requirement of gene transformation. Here, we used the unlabeled pathogens Parastagonospora nodorum, Pyrenophora teres f. teres, and Cercospora beticola infecting wheat, barley, and sugar beet, respectively, to show the utility of a staining and imaging pipeline that uses propidium iodide (PI), which stains RNA and DNA, and wheat germ agglutinin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (WGA-FITC), which stains chitin, to visualize fungal colonization of plants. This pipeline relies on the use of KOH to remove the cutin layer of the leaf, increasing its permeability, allowing the different stains to penetrate and effectively bind to their targets, resulting in a consistent visualization of cellular structures. To expand the utility of this pipeline, we used the staining techniques in conjunction with machine learning to analyze fungal biomass through volume analysis, as well as quantifying nuclear breakdown, an early indicator of programmed cell death (PCD). This pipeline is simple to use, robust, consistent across host and fungal species, and can be applied to most plant-fungal interactions. Therefore, this pipeline can be used to characterize model systems as well as nonmodel interactions where transformation is not routine. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Confocal Microscopy; Fungal Pathogens; Machine Learning; Propidium Iodide; Propidium; Propidium Iodide; Ascomycetes; Beet; Chemistry; Confocal Microscopy; Fungus; Genetics; Hordeum; Host Pathogen Interaction; Image Processing; Metabolism; Microbiology; Physiology; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Procedures; Wheat; Ascomycota; Beta Vulgaris; Fungi; Host-pathogen Interactions; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Microscopy, Confocal; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Propidium; Triticum","propidium iodide; Ascomycetes; beet; chemistry; confocal microscopy; fungus; genetics; Hordeum; host pathogen interaction; image processing; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; plant disease; plant leaf; procedures; wheat; Ascomycota; Beta vulgaris; Fungi; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy, Confocal; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Propidium; Triticum",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213490290

However, soybean yields are frequently compromised by disease and pest infestations, which, if not identified early, can lead to substantial production losses. To address this challenge, we propose AgriNAS, a method that integrates a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework with an adaptive convolutional architecture specifically designed for plant pathology. AgriNAS employs a novel data augmentation strategy and a Spatial–Time Augmentation (STA) method, and it utilizes a multi-stage convolutional network that dynamically adapts to the complexity of the input data. The proposed AgriNAS leverages powerful GPU resources to handle the intensive computational tasks involved in NAS and model training. The framework incorporates a bi-level optimization strategy and entropy-based regularization to enhance model robustness and prevent overfitting.

Despite its agricultural importance, the evolutionary dynamics and emergence process of TbCSV remain poorly understood. This study analyzed the phylodynamics of TbCSV by examining its nucleotide sequences of the coat protein (CP) gene collected between 2000 and 2022. Using various combinations of priors, Bayes factor comparisons identified heterochronous datasets (3 × 100 million chains) generated from a strict molecular clock and Bayesian skyline tree priors as the most robust. The mean substitution rate of the CP gene was estimated at 6.50 × 10−4 substitutions/site/year (95% credibility interval: 4.74 × 10−4–8.50 × 10−4). TbCSV was inferred to have diverged around 1920 CE (95% credibility interval: 1887–1952), with its most probable origin in South Asia.

These pathways include the cytoskeleton, a proteinaceous network that senses external cues at the cell surface and signals to interior cellular components. During biotic stress, dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements serve as a platform from which early immune-associated processes are organized and activated. Bacterial pathogens of plants and animals use proteins called type III effectors (T3Es) to interfere with host immune signaling, thereby promoting virulence. We previously found that RipU, a T3E from the soilborne phytobacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, co-localizes with the plant cytoskeleton. Here, we show that RipU from R. solanacearum K60 (RipUK60) associated with and altered the organization of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. We found that pharmacological disruption of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cytoskeleton promoted R. solanacearum K60 colonization. Importantly, tomato plants inoculated with R. solanacearum K60 lacking RipUK60 (ΔripUK60) had reduced wilting symptoms and significantly reduced root colonization when compared to plants inoculated with wild-type R. solanacearum K60. Collectively, our data suggest that R. solanacearum K60 uses the type III effector RipUK60 to remodel cytoskeletal organization, thereby promoting pathogen virulence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Actins; Bacterial Proteins; Type Iii Secretion Systems; Amersham Imagequant 500 Ccd Imaging System; C18 Trap Column; Csu-x1-a1; Ix-83 Inverted Microscope; Ixon Ultra 897bv Emccd Camera; Proquest Yeast-hybrid System; Proteome Discoverer Version 3.1; Actin; Genomic Dna; Green Fluorescent Protein; Plant Protein; Bacterial Protein; Agrobacterium Tumefaciens; Article; Bacterial Virulence; Bacterium Culture; Bioassay; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Confocal Microscopy; Cytoskeleton; Image Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Microtubule; Nonhuman; Plant Growth; Plasmid; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Proteomics; Quantitative Analysis; Ralstonia Solanacearum; Rna Sequencing; Tomato; Yeast Two Hybrid Assay; Actin Filament; Metabolism; Microbiology; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Type Iii Secretion System; Virulence; Actin Cytoskeleton; Actins; Bacterial Proteins; Cytoskeleton; Microtubules; Plant Diseases; Solanum Lycopersicum; Type Iii Secretion Systems; Virulence,actin; genomic DNA; green fluorescent protein; plant protein; bacterial protein; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Article; bacterial virulence; bacterium culture; bioassay; chromatin immunoprecipitation; confocal microscopy; cytoskeleton; image analysis; mass spectrometry; microtubule; nonhuman; plant growth; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; proteomics; quantitative analysis; Ralstonia solanacearum; RNA sequencing; tomato; yeast two hybrid assay; actin filament; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; plant disease; type III secretion system; virulence; Actin Cytoskeleton; Actins; Bacterial Proteins; Cytoskeleton; Microtubules; Plant Diseases; Solanum lycopersicum; Type III Secretion Systems; Virulence,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213241170

Further it provides many medicinal and health benefits to the society to treat various degenerative disease. Especially mango leaves are potential source of minerals like nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium and vitamins. In Particular, these most beneficial plant were exposed to various disease in its growing regions due to several environment changes. Hence it becomes mandatory to protect and prevent the plant against the disease using precautionary measures. Even though there exist large solutions to combat these issues still it requires a strong solutions to examine those disease and categorize it into various forms to establish a effective countermeasures. Many researches has been initiated using machine learning and deep learning to detect the disease and its types but those approaches fails to discriminate diseases effectively in early stages. In this work, a new deep learning model entitled as Multivariate Gated Recurrent Network composed of Input layer, hidden layer, abstract layer and output layer contains various state like hidden state, forgot state, update state and Reset state is employed to analyze the disease region of the image in detail towards effective discrimination in early stages. In particular abstraction layer has been combined with graph cut segmentation algorithm to improves the efficiency of the network by searching and grouping of seed points which represents the infected region of leafs has common attributes. Those common attributes generate the best features for classification. Further optimization of gated recurrent network is carried out using grey wolf optimization to eliminate the network over fitting issues on increasing the speed and accuracy of the network to identify and classify the regions infected of different diseases on the plant leafs on different diseases perspectives. Experimental analysis of proposed architecture on cross fold validation of plant village dataset explains the model accuracy and efficiency with respect to execution performance in terms of training accuracy and validation accuracy respectively for disease identification.

Furthermore, a concept for the analysis of quality assured hyperspectral images to investigate plant disease progress is proposed. The quality assurance was applied to a handheld line scanning HSI-system consisting of evaluating spatial and spectral quality parameters as well as the integrated illumination. To test the spatial accuracy at different working distances, the sine-wave-based spatial frequency response (s-SFR) was analysed. The spectral accuracy was assessed by calculating the correlation of calibration-material measurements between the HSI-system and a non-imaging spectrometer. Additionally, different illumination systems were evaluated by analysing the spectral response of sugar beet canopies. As a use case, time series HSI measurements of sugar beet plants infested with Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) were performed to estimate the disease severity using convolutional neural network (CNN) supported data analysis. Results: The measurements of the calibration material were highly correlated with those of the non-imaging spectrometer (r>0.99). The resolution limit was narrowly missed at each of the tested working distances. Slight sharpness differences within individual images could be detected. The use of the integrated LED illumination for HSI can cause a distortion of the spectral response at 677nm and 752nm. The performance for CLS diseased pixel detection of the established CNN was sufficient to estimate a reliable disease severity progression from quality assured hyperspectral measurements with external illumination. Conclusion: The quality assurance pipeline was successfully applied to evaluate a handheld HSI-system. The s-SFR analysis is a valuable method for assessing the spatial accuracy of HSI-systems. Comparing measurements between HSI-systems and a non-imaging spectrometer can provide reliable results on the spectral accuracy of the tested system. This research emphasizes the importance of evenly distributed diffuse illumination for HSI. Although the tested system showed shortcomings in image resolution, sharpness, and illumination, the high spectral accuracy of the tested HSI-system, supported by external illumination, enabled the establishment of a neural network-based concept to determine the severity and progression of CLS. The data driven quality assurance pipeline can be easily applied to any other HSI-system to ensure high quality HSI. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computer Vision; Illumination; Image Resolution; Image Sharpness; Machine Learning; Plant Diseases; Remote Sensing; Spatial Accuracy; Spectral Accuracy,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212691761

An effective solution is required to address the issues caused by the manual identification of plant diseases, which is time-consuming and has low detection accuracy. This paper proposes the development of a robust Deep Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (DECNN) model for the accurate detection of sugarcane leaf diseases. Initially, several transfer learning (TL) models, including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, NASNetMobile, and EfficientNetV2B0, were enhanced through the addition of specific layers. A comparative analysis was then conducted on the enlarged dataset of sugarcane leaf diseases, which was divided into six categories and 4800 images. The application of data augmentation, along with the addition of dense layers, batch normalization layers, and dropout layers, led to improved detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for each model. Among the five enhanced transfer learning models, the modified EfficientNetB0 model demonstrated the highest detection accuracy, ranging from 97.08% to 98.54%. In conclusion, the DECNN model was developed by integrating the modified EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121 models using a distinctive performance-based custom-weighted ensemble method, with weight optimization carried out using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) technique. This resulted in a model that achieved a detection accuracy of 99.17%, which outperformed the individual performance of the modified EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121 models in detecting sugarcane leaf diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cnn; Deep Learning; Ensemble Learning; Sugarcane Leaf Diseases; Transfer Learning,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211907413

This gap limits the ability to accurately predict the ecological effects of sugar beet cultivation, particularly regarding climate change, eutrophication, acidification, human toxicity, and terrestrial and aquatic ecotoxicity. Moreover, optimizing agricultural productivity and integrating artificial intelligence (AI) are necessary to improve energy management and anticipate future consumption patterns, considering current constraints. Our innovative solution combines LCA with AI to better forecast the ecological impacts of sugar beet cultivation across farms of different sizes. By using historical data and advanced neural models, this method anticipates future energy consumption while integrating environmental and energy constraints. The study highlights that medium-sized farms (MF) show the lowest environmental impacts, according to the CML and USEtox methodologies, unlike small (SF) and large farms (LF), which do not significantly differ in their contribution to pollutants. The average energy consumption for beet production was 1,092,000 MJ/ha on small farms, 1,126,100 MJ/ha on medium farms, and 1,107,080 MJ/ha on large farms. The key critical points identified were related to the use of diesel, machinery, seeds, and pesticides. In terms of energy distribution, chemical fertilizers accounted for 41 % of the total energy used, followed by fuel (24 %), pesticides (18 %), and machinery (7 %). Neural models revealed correlation coefficients (R2) ranging from 0.634 to 0.945 for testing, 0.861 to 0.967 for validation, and 0.944 to 0.982 for training. These results suggest good predictive accuracy for our AI-based approach. Finally, to improve energy efficiency, the study proposes modernizing agricultural equipment and developing more sustainable technologies, such as hybrid tractors, robotic and automated weeding systems, and cultivation techniques that reduce carbon emissions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Climate Change; Environmental Impact; Lifecycle Assessment; Neural Networks; Sugar Beets; 'current; Energy; Energy Emissions; Energy-consumption; Environmental Emissions; Life Cycle Assessment (lca); Management Method; Neural Modelling; Neural Network Model; Neural-networks,Sugar beets; 'current; Energy; Energy emissions; Energy-consumption; Environmental emissions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management method; Neural modelling; Neural network model; Neural-networks,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209347253

Utilizing the YOLOv8 framework and community-developed, actively-maintained Python libraries such as OpenCV, BerryPortraits software was trained on 512 postharvest images (taken under controlled lighting conditions) of phenotypically diverse cranberry populations (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) from the two largest public cranberry breeding programs in the U.S. The implementation of CIELAB, an intuitive and perceptually uniform color space, enables differentiation between berry color and berry brightness, which are confounded in classic RGB color channel measurements. Furthermore, computer vision enables precise and quantifiable color phenotyping, thus facilitating inclusion of researchers and data analysts with color vision deficiency.

Unfortunately, these fruits are susceptible to many different kinds of diseases caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Such diseases can have a major negative impact on fruit quality, production, and the profitability of pomegranate cultivation. Nowadays, several machine learning and deep learning methods are used to identify pomegranate fruit diseases automatically and effectively. In post-harvest pomegranate fruit disease detection, deep learning has great potential to extract complex patterns and features from large datasets. This can improve disease identification accuracy, enabling more efficient disease control, lower crop losses, and better resource management. The proposed work introduces an intelligent deep learning-based approach for accurately detecting pomegranate diseases, begins with Improved Guided Image Filtering (Improved GIF) and resizing to pre-process fruit images, followed by feature extraction (shape, color, texture) using GLCM and GLRLM to streamline classification. Extracted features are then fed into a novel Hybrid Optimal Attention Capsule Network (Hybrid OACapsNet), which classifies the images as normal or diseased, conditions such as bacterial blight, heart rot, and scab. Our analysis indicates that the proposed classifier has a classification accuracy of 99.19 %, precision of 98.45 %, recall of 98.41 %, F1-score of 98.43 %, and specificity of 99.45 % compared to other techniques.

However, even for seemingly identical ripening processes, the associated gene expression networks often evolved independently, as reflected by the diversity in the interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and the targeted cis-regulatory elements (CREs). In this study, explainable deep learning (DL) frameworks were used to predict expression patterns on the basis of CREs in promoter sequences. We initially screened potential lineage-specific CRE–TF interactions influencing the kiwifruit ripening process, which is triggered by ethylene, similar to the corresponding processes in other climacteric fruit crops. Some novel regulatory relationships affecting ethylene-induced fruit ripening were identified. Specifically, ABI5-like bZIP, G2-like, and MYB81-like TFs were revealed as trans-factors modulating the expression of representative ethylene signaling/biosynthesis-related genes (e.g., ACS1, ERT2, and ERF143). Transient reporter assays and DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-Seq) analyses validated these CRE–TF interactions and their regulatory relationships. A comparative analysis with co-expression networking suggested that this DL-based screening can identify regulatory networks independently of co-expression patterns. Our results highlight the utility of an explainable DL approach for identifying novel CRE–TF interactions. These imply that fruit crop species may have evolved lineage-specific fruit ripening-related cis–trans regulatory networks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cis-regulatory Elements; Deep Learning; Ethylene; Ripening; Ethylene; Ethylene; Ethylenes; Plant Proteins; Transcription Factors; Gene Encoding; Plant Diseases; Transcription; Transcription Factors; Cis-regulatory Elements; Cis-trans; Deep Learning; Expression Patterns; Fruit Crops; Kiwifruits; Regulatory Network; Regulatory Relationships; Ripening; Ripening Process; Fruits; Biosynthesis; Ethylene; Genes; Networks; Patterns; Processes; Ethylene; Ethylene Derivative; Plant Protein; Transcription Factor; Actinidia; Fruit; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Network; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Promoter Region; Ethylenes; Fruit; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Regulatory Networks; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transcription Factors","Gene encoding; Plant diseases; Transcription; Transcription factors; Cis-regulatory elements; Cis-trans; Deep learning; Expression patterns; Fruit crops; Kiwifruits; Regulatory network; Regulatory relationships; Ripening; Ripening process; Fruits; Biosynthesis; Ethylene; Genes; Networks; Patterns; Processes; ethylene; ethylene derivative; plant protein; transcription factor; Actinidia; fruit; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; promoter region; Ethylenes; Fruit; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Regulatory Networks; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transcription Factors",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207899931

However, its role in fighting soil-borne virus-induced diseases, such as wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) transmitted by Polymyxa graminis zoospores, remains largely underexplored. In this study, we hypothesized that during viral infections, plant microbiomes engage in critical interactions with plants, with key microbes playing vital roles in maintaining plant health. Our research aimed to identify microbial taxa that not only suppress the disease but also boost wheat yield by using a blend of techniques, including field surveys, yield assessments, high-throughput sequencing of plant and soil microbiomes, microbial isolation, hydroponic experiments, and transcriptome sequencing. Results: We found that, compared with roots and leaves, the rhizosphere microbiome showed a better performance in predicting wheat yield and the prevalence of P. graminis and WYMV across the three WYMV-impacted regions in China. Using machine learning, we found that healthy rhizospheres were marked with potentially beneficial microorganisms, such as Sphingomonas and Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Parararhizobium-Rhizobium, whereas diseased rhizospheres were associated with a higher prevalence of potential pathogens, such as Bipolaris and Fusicolla. Structural equation modeling showed that these biomarkers both directly and indirectly impacted wheat yield by modulating the rhizosphere microbiome and P. graminis abundance. Upon re-introduction of two key healthy rhizosphere biomarkers, Sphingomonas azotifigens and Rhizobium deserti, into the rhizosphere, wheat growth and health were enhanced. This was attributed to the up-regulation of auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways and the regulation of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid pathways during infections. Conclusions: Overall, our study revealed the critical role of the rhizosphere microbiome in combating soil-borne viral diseases, with specific rhizosphere microbes playing key roles in this process. 9s7rr2_Gfui1KYKQgMf1m6Video Abstract. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Jasmonic Acid; Plant-associated Microbiome; Polymyxa Graminis; Rhizosphere; Salicylic Acid; Soil-borne Viral Disease; Triticum Aestivum L; Indoleacetic Acid; Jasmonic Acid; Salicylic Acid; Indoleacetic Acids; Plant Growth Regulators; Fast Dna Spin Kit; Hipure Plant Rna Mini Kit; Miseq Pe250; Nanodrop; Nanodrop 2000; Nebnext Ultra Dna Library Prep Kit; Novaseq 6000; Qubit 4.0; R Software Version 4.1.0; Ammonium Nitrogen; Arabidopsis Response Regulator; Auxin; Auxin Response Factor; Cytokinin; Dissolved Organic Carbon; Fertilizer; Indoleacetic Acid; Internal Transcribed Spacer; Jasmonic Acid; Nitrate Nitrogen; Pathogenesis Related Protein; Rna 16s; Rna 18s; Salicylic Acid; Transcription Activation Factor; Transcriptome; Unclassified Drug; Indoleacetic Acid Derivative; Phytohormone; Agar Gel Electrophoresis; Agrobacterium Vitis; Article; Bacterial Growth; Climate Change; Controlled Study; Correlation Analysis; Differential Expression Analysis; Dna Extraction; Gene Ontology; Hormone Pathway Modulation; Kegg; Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size; Machine Learning; Microbial Interaction; Microbial Isolation; Modulation; Molecular Biology; Neorhizobium; Nonhuman; Parararhizobium; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymyxa; Prevalence; Principal Component Analysis; Protozoal Community; Quantitative Analysis; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rhizobium; Rhizobium Deserti; Rhizosphere; Rna Extraction; Rna Sequencing; Root Volume; Root Diameter; Sampling Site; Sanger Sequencing; Sequence Processing; Shannon Index; Shoot Biomass; Signal Transduction; Soil Suspension; Soil And Soil Related Phenomena; Sphingomonas; Sphingomonas Azotifigens; Temperature; Transcriptome Sequencing; Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus; Wheat Yellow Mosaic Virus; China; Metabolism; Microbiology; Microflora; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Plant Root; Virology; Wheat; Indoleacetic Acids; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Plant Diseases; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Rhizosphere; Soil Microbiology; Triticum,ammonium nitrogen; arabidopsis response regulator; auxin; auxin response factor; cytokinin; dissolved organic carbon; fertilizer; indoleacetic acid; internal transcribed spacer; jasmonic acid; nitrate nitrogen; pathogenesis related protein; RNA 16S; RNA 18S; salicylic acid; transcription activation factor; transcriptome; unclassified drug; indoleacetic acid derivative; phytohormone; agar gel electrophoresis; Agrobacterium vitis; Article; bacterial growth; climate change; controlled study; correlation analysis; differential expression analysis; DNA extraction; gene ontology; hormone pathway modulation; KEGG; linear discriminant analysis effect size; machine learning; microbial interaction; microbial isolation; modulation; molecular biology; Neorhizobium; nonhuman; Parararhizobium; polymerase chain reaction; Polymyxa; prevalence; principal component analysis; protozoal community; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; Rhizobium; Rhizobium deserti; rhizosphere; RNA extraction; RNA sequencing; root volume; root diameter; sampling site; Sanger sequencing; sequence processing; Shannon index; shoot biomass; signal transduction; soil suspension; soil and soil related phenomena; Sphingomonas; Sphingomonas azotifigens; temperature; transcriptome sequencing; Turnip yellow mosaic virus; wheat yellow mosaic virus; China; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; plant disease; plant leaf; plant root; virology; wheat; Indoleacetic Acids; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Plant Diseases; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Rhizosphere; Soil Microbiology; Triticum,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206556720

As the existing information is available in the form of relevant environmental covariates, its combination with non-parametric machine learning techniques requires careful planning from the initial field sampling to the final production of digital soil maps. The aim of this study is to compare widely used covariate-wise sampling designs combined with variable sample sizes for supervised prediction of common soil drivers of agricultural productivity (pH, soil organic carbon, soil macronutrients) in a real case study of a field (35 ha) with heterogeneous soil properties. From a total of 200 samples, we evaluated different sample sets where 10, 30 and 60 field samples were selected by conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) and Feature Space Coverage Sampling (FSCS) to calibrate random forest (RF) models. The evaluation was performed on independently in-situ sampled test points. In addition to these datasets, we also compared the investigated methods with Simple Random Sampling (SRS) in a numerical benchmark experiment with increasing sample size, comparing the global accuracies of the predicted maps on the test points, but using interpolated maps as the artificial true population for each soil characteristic. The results of the study in both the field experiment and the numerical experiment showed slightly better results for the FSCS method, especially when the number of samples was small. At smaller training sample sizes, the risk of insufficiently accurate prediction models was slightly lower for FSCS and the difference decreased as the sample size increased. Nevertheless, sample size proved to be the most important factor in the accuracy of RF models, regardless of the sampling technique. The results suggest that a sample size between 18 and 30 training samples (0.6 to 1 sample ha−1) seems plausible for covariate-wise predictions using RF at field scale in our case study. The relative importance of each auxiliary variable for each RF calibration was also assessed for the field experiment. The results showed that the additional introduction of spatial proxies overshadowed the importance of other covariates, but only significantly improved the model calibration at larger sample sizes. The calibrated models without spatial proxies showed the strongest effect of remotely sensed surface characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Clhs; Digital Soil Mapping; Fscs; Random Forest; Sampling; Smart Farming,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205721931

The proliferation of experimental and analytical methods used in biology has resulted in a situation where plentiful data exists, but the volume and heterogeneity of this data has made analysis a significant challenge. Current advanced deep-learning models have displayed an unprecedented level of comprehension and problem-solving ability, and have been used to predict gene structure, function and expression based on DNA or protein sequence, and prominently also their use in high-throughput phenomics in agriculture. However, the application of deep-learning models to understand gene regulatory and signalling behaviour is still in its infancy. We discuss in this review the availability of data resources and bioinformatic tools, and several applications of these advanced ML/AI models in the context of plant stress response, and demonstrate the use of a publicly available LLM (ChatGPT) to derive a knowledge graph of various experimental and computational methods used in the study of plant stress. We hope this will stimulate further interest in collaboration between computer scientists, computational biologists and plant scientists to distil the deluge of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and phenomic data into meaningful knowledge that can be used for the benefit of humanity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Large Language Models; Large-scale Data; Plant Stress Resilience; Dna; Deep Learning; Gene Expression; Plant Diseases; Functional Basis; Genomic Era; Genomics; High-throughput Data; Language Model; Large Language Model; Large Scale Data; Learning Models; Plant Stress; Plant Stress Resilience; Dna; Amino Acid Sequence; Analytic Method; Artificial Intelligence; Biologist; Chatgpt; Deep Learning; Gene Structure; Genomics; Large Language Model; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Phenomics; Plant Stress; Problem Solving; Review; Signal Transduction,Deep learning; Gene expression; Plant diseases; Functional basis; Genomic era; Genomics; High-throughput data; Language model; Large language model; Large scale data; Learning models; Plant stress; Plant stress resilience; DNA; amino acid sequence; analytic method; artificial intelligence; biologist; ChatGPT; deep learning; gene structure; genomics; large language model; machine learning; nonhuman; phenomics; plant stress; problem solving; review; signal transduction,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205292409

Jute (Corchorus sp.) is an important natural fiber crop with strong absorption and excellent adaptability to metal-stressed environments, used in the phytoextraction of heavy metals. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying Cd tolerance and accumulation in plants is essential for efficient phytoremediation strategies and breeding novel Cd-tolerant cultivars. Here, machine learning (ML) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combining genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and RNA-seq reveal the genetic basis of Cd resistance and absorption in jute. ML needs a small number of plant phenotypes for training and can complete the plant phenotyping of large-scale populations with efficiency and accuracy greater than 90%. In particular, a candidate gene for Cd resistance (COS02g_02406) and a candidate gene (COS06g_03984) associated with Cd absorption are identified in isoflavonoid biosynthesis and ethylene response signaling pathways. COS02g_02406 may enable plants to cope with metal stress by regulating isoflavonoid biosynthesis involved in antioxidant defense and metal chelation. COS06g_03984 promotes the binding of Cd2+ to ETR/ERS, resulting in Cd absorption and tolerance. The results confirm the feasibility of high-throughput phenotyping for studying plant Cd tolerance by combining HSI and ML approaches, facilitating future molecular breeding. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cadmium; Corchorus Sp., Hyperspectral Imaging; Genome-wide Association Studies (gwas); Machine Learning; Phytoremediation; Cadmium; Daidzein; Genistein; Isoflavone; Cadmium; Soil Pollutants; Kobas Software; Nebnext Ultra Rna Library Prep Kit For Illumina; Novaseq6000; Optima8300; Jute Fibers; Plant Diseases; Cadmium Resistance; Cadmium Tolerance; Candidate Genes; Corchorus Sp, Hyperspectral Imaging; Genetic Basis; Genome-wide Association Studies; Genome-wide Association Study; Hyperspectral; Machine-learning; Phytoremediation; Heavy Metals; Antioxidant; Cadmium; Daidzein; Genistein; Isoflavone; Isoflavonoid; Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 9; Transcriptome; Absorption; Angiosperm; Genome; Machine Learning; Multispectral Image; Phenotype; Rna; Tolerance; Article; Biosynthesis; Breeding; Drug Absorption; Drug Tolerance; Gene Expression; Gene Ontology; Genome-wide Association Study; Germplasm; High Throughput Sequencing; Hydroponics; Hyperspectral Imaging; Intracellular Signaling; Jute; Light Intensity; Mapk Signaling; Oxidative Stress; Photosynthesis; Physiological Stress; Phytoextraction; Phytoremediation; Plant Growth; Plant Root; Rna Isolation; Rna Sequence; Rna Sequencing; Signal Transduction; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Spectroscopy; Upregulation; Whole Genome Sequencing; Bioremediation; Metabolism; Soil Pollutant; Toxicity; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cadmium; Genome-wide Association Study; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Soil Pollutants","Jute fibers; Plant diseases; Cadmium resistance; Cadmium tolerance; Candidate genes; Corchorus sp, hyperspectral imaging; Genetic basis; Genome-wide association studies; Genome-wide association study; HyperSpectral; Machine-learning; Phytoremediation; Heavy metals; antioxidant; cadmium; daidzein; genistein; isoflavone; isoflavonoid; mitogen activated protein kinase 9; transcriptome; absorption; angiosperm; genome; machine learning; multispectral image; phenotype; RNA; tolerance; Article; biosynthesis; breeding; drug absorption; drug tolerance; gene expression; gene ontology; genome-wide association study; germplasm; high throughput sequencing; hydroponics; hyperspectral imaging; intracellular signaling; jute; light intensity; MAPK signaling; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; physiological stress; phytoextraction; phytoremediation; plant growth; plant root; RNA isolation; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; spectroscopy; upregulation; whole genome sequencing; bioremediation; metabolism; soil pollutant; toxicity; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cadmium; Genome-Wide Association Study; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Soil Pollutants",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204181763

This study employed artificial neural networks to predict the tar potential and maceral recognition considering the case of tar-rich coal in northern Shaanxi Province. A deep neural network model based on the U-Net architecture was utilised for high-precision quantitative analysis of macerals. In addition, traditional instrumental analyses were conducted to acquire fundamental coal quality parameters, such as industrial analysis, elemental analysis, and tar yield data. Subsequently, key features closely related to tar yield were carefully selected through correlation analysis. Finally, multiple statistical regression (MSR), backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed to construct a tar yield prediction model. Experimental results revealed that the hydrogen-rich feature parameters (V<inf>ad</inf>, H<inf>d</inf>, and V) in tar-rich coal exhibited the most pronounced influence on tar yield. In terms of maceral recognition, U-Net performed exceptionally well, achieving an average accuracy of 72.16%, with the prediction accuracy for the four main macerals (vitrinite, inertinite, carbonate minerals, and sulfide minerals) surpassing 90.00%. With respect to the tar yield prediction, the neural network predictive models surpassed the MSR predictive models in terms of performance. Both the BPNN and CNN prediction models had a coefficient of determination greater than or equal to 0.95, especially for the Group CNN prediction model optimised by group convolution, which had a coefficient of determination as high as 0.98, an average absolute error as low as 0.18%, and a root mean square error of only 0.24%. The application of neural networks in deciphering the maceral and tar-producing characteristics of tar-rich coal can significantly enhance the associated analytical efficiency and precision. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Neural Network; Maceral Recognition; Tar Yield Prediction; Tar-rich Coal; Coal Tar; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Neural Networks; Back-propagation Neural Networks; Convolutional Neural Network; Maceral Recognition; Macerals; Neural-networks; Predictive Models; Statistical Regression; Tar Yield Prediction; Tar-rich Coal; Yield Prediction; Prediction Models,Coal tar; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Back-propagation neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Maceral recognition; Macerals; Neural-networks; Predictive models; Statistical regression; Tar yield prediction; Tar-rich coal; Yield prediction; Prediction models,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201283577

We used two wildtype GFLV strains and their single amino acid mutants to assess RSA traits in infected Nicotiana benthamiana and evaluate transcriptomic changes in host root gene expression in replicated time course 3’RNA-Seq experiments. Mutations targeted the multi-functional GFLV-encoded protein 1EPol*/Sd, a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and determinant of foliar symptoms in N. benthamiana plants. Results: Plant infection with wildtype GFLV strain GHu and mutant GFLV strain F13 1EPol<inf>G802K</inf>, both carrying a lysine in position 802 of protein 1EPol*/Sd, resulted in a significantly lower number of root tips (-30%), and a significantly increased average root diameter (+ 20%) at 17 days post inoculation (dpi) in comparison with roots of mock inoculated plants. In contrast, the RSA of plants infected with wildtype GFLV strain F13 and mutant GFLV strain GHu 1EPol<inf>K802G</inf>, both carrying a glycine in position 802 of protein 1EPol*/Sd, resembled that of mock inoculated plants. Modifications of RSA traits were not associated with GFLV titer. Root tissue transcriptome analysis at 17 dpi indicated dysregulation of pattern recognition receptors, plant hormones, RNA silencing, and genes related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). For wildtype GFLV strain GHu, RSA modifications were correlated with an abundant accumulation of ROS in the pericycle of primary roots at 7 dpi and the duration of vein clearing symptom expression in apical leaves. Dysegulation of a hypersensitive response was an overarching gene ontology found through enrichment analyses of 3’RNA-Seq data. Conclusions: Our findings revealed the causative role of lysine in position 802 of protein 1EPol*/Sd in a novel RSA phenotype during viral infection and documented GFLV-N. benthamiana interactions at the root level based on (i) antiviral response, (ii) receptor mediated production of ROS, and (iii) hormone regulation. A correlation between above and below ground symptoms was reported for the first time in plants infected with wildtype GFLV strain GHu. Further work is warranted to test whether the modified RSA of a plant host might impact GFLV acquisition and transmission by the ectoparasitic dagger nematode Xiphinema index. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Immune Response; Infection; Phenotype; Plant; Reactive Oxygen Species; Root Architecture; Symptoms; Virus; Amino Acid; Amino Acids; Viral Proteins; Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Epson Expression Xl12000 Photo Scanner; Nextseq500 550; Olympus Szx12; Onestep Rt Pcr Kit; Truseq Rna Library Prep Kit; Amino Acid; Transcriptome; Viral Protein; Article; Biomass; Controlled Study; Dna Extraction; Gene Control; Gene Expression Profiling; Hormonal Regulation; Image Processing; Inoculation; Nematode; Nicotiana Benthamiana; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Plant Height; Plant Leaf; Primary Root; Principal Component Analysis; Quality Control; Rna Extraction; Rna Interference; Rna Sequencing; Root Morphology; Root System; Sanger Sequencing; Virus Cell Interaction; Virus Infection; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Grapevine Fanleaf Virus; Host Pathogen Interaction; Metabolism; Mutation; Nepovirus; Nicotiana; Plant Disease; Plant Root; Virology; Vitis; Amino Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Host-pathogen Interactions; Mutation; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Transcriptome; Viral Proteins","amino acid; transcriptome; viral protein; Article; biomass; controlled study; DNA extraction; gene control; gene expression profiling; hormonal regulation; image processing; inoculation; nematode; Nicotiana benthamiana; nonhuman; phenotype; plant height; plant leaf; primary root; principal component analysis; quality control; RNA extraction; RNA interference; RNA sequencing; root morphology; root system; Sanger sequencing; virus cell interaction; virus infection; gene expression regulation; genetics; Grapevine fanleaf virus; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; mutation; Nepovirus; Nicotiana; plant disease; plant root; virology; Vitis; Amino Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Mutation; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Transcriptome; Viral Proteins",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199240009

However, CB cultivation poses a significant threat to diseases that can drastically reduce yield and quality. Detecting these diseases solely based on visual symptoms is challenging, due to the variability across different pathogens and similar symptoms caused by distinct pathogens, further complicating the detection process. Traditional methods relying solely on farmers’ ability to detect diseases is inadequate, and while engaging expert pathologists and advanced laboratories is necessary, it can also be resource intensive. To address this challenge, we present a AI-driven system for rapid and cost-effective CB disease detection, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning and object detection technologies. We utilized an extensive image dataset collected from disease hotspots in Africa and Colombia, focusing on five major diseases: Angular Leaf Spot (ALS), Common Bacterial Blight (CBB), Common Bean Mosaic Virus (CBMV), Bean Rust, and Anthracnose, covering both leaf and pod samples in real-field settings. However, pod images are only available for Angular Leaf Spot disease. The study employed data augmentation techniques and annotation at both whole and micro levels for comprehensive analysis. To train the model, we utilized three advanced YOLO architectures: YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLO-NAS. Particularly for whole leaf annotations, the YOLO-NAS model achieves the highest mAP value of up to 97.9% and a recall of 98.8%, indicating superior detection accuracy. In contrast, for whole pod disease detection, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 outperformed YOLO-NAS, with mAP values exceeding 95% and 93% recall. However, micro annotation consistently yields lower performance than whole annotation across all disease classes and plant parts, as examined by all YOLO models, highlighting an unexpected discrepancy in detection accuracy. Furthermore, we successfully deployed YOLO-NAS annotation models into an Android app, validating their effectiveness on unseen data from disease hotspots with high classification accuracy (90%). This accomplishment showcases the integration of deep learning into our production pipeline, a process known as DLOps. This innovative approach significantly reduces diagnosis time, enabling farmers to take prompt management interventions. The potential benefits extend beyond rapid diagnosis serving as an early warning system to enhance common bean productivity and quality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Africa; Agriculture; Colombia; Deep Learning; Microbiology; Phaseolus; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Procedures; Virology; Agriculture; Deep Learning; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves,Africa; agriculture; Colombia; deep learning; microbiology; Phaseolus; plant disease; plant leaf; procedures; virology; Agriculture; Deep Learning; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197676372

Seed shape studies of wheat typically involve the use of digital image analysis software to quantify various seed shape parameters such as length, width, area, aspect ratio, roundness, and symmetry. This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the water-absorbing capacity of seeds from 120 distinct wheat lines, leveraging digital image analysis techniques facilitated by SmartGrain software. Water absorption is a pivotal process in the early stages of seed germination, directly influencing plant growth and crop yield. SmartGrain, a powerful image analysis tool, was employed to extract precise quantitative data from digital images of wheat seeds, enabling the assessment of various seed traits in relation to their water-absorbing capacity. The analysis revealed significant transformations in seed characteristics as they absorbed water, including changes in size, weight, shape, and more. Through statistical analysis and correlation assessments, we identified robust relationships between these seed traits, both before and after water treatment. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) were employed to categorize genotypes with similar trait patterns, providing insights valuable for crop breeding and genetic research. Multiple linear regression analysis further elucidated the influence of specific seed traits, such as weight, width, and distance, on water-absorbing capacity. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of seed development, imbibition, and the crucial role of water absorption in wheat. These insights have practical implications in agriculture, offering opportunities to optimize breeding programs for improved water absorption in wheat genotypes. The integration of SmartGrain software with advanced statistical methods enhances the reliability and significance of our findings, paving the way for more efficient and resilient wheat crop production. Significant changes in wheat seed shape parameters were observed after imbibition, with notable increases in area, perimeter, length, width, and weight. The length-to-width ratio (LWR) and circularity displayed opposite trends, with higher values before imbibition and lower values after imbibition. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Digital Image Analysis; Imbibition; Shape; Size; Smartgrain; Wheat Genotypes; Wheat Seeds; Genetics; Germination; Human; Plant Breeding; Plant Seed; Reproducibility; Software; Wheat; Germination; Humans; Plant Breeding; Reproducibility Of Results; Seeds; Software; Triticum,genetics; germination; human; plant breeding; plant seed; reproducibility; software; wheat; Germination; Humans; Plant Breeding; Reproducibility of Results; Seeds; Software; Triticum,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188275354

As a potential solution, the application of plant growth regulators to enhance drought and salinity tolerance has gained considerable attention. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a four-carbon non-protein amino acid that accumulates in plants as a response to stressful conditions. This study focused on a comparative assessment of several machine learning (ML) regression models, including radial basis function, generalized regression neural network (GRNN), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR) to develop predictive models for assessing the effect of different concentrations of GABA (0, 10, 20, and 40 mM) on various physio-biochemical traits during periods of drought, salinity, and combined stress conditions. The physio-biochemical traits included antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, SOD; peroxidase, POD; catalase, CAT; and ascorbate peroxidase, APX), protein content, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) levels. The non‑dominated sorting genetic algorithm‑II (NSGA‑II) was employed for optimizing the superior prediction model. Results: The GRNN model outperformed the other ML algorithms and was therefore selected for optimization by NSGA-II. The GRNN-NSGA-II model revealed that treatment with GABA at concentrations of 20.90 mM and 20.54 mM, under combined drought and salinity stress conditions at 20.86 and 20.72 days post-treatment, respectively, could result in the maximum values for protein content (by 0.80 and 0.69), APX activity (by 50.63 and 51.51), SOD activity (by 0.54 and 0.53), POD activity (by 1.53 and 1.72), CAT activity (by 4.42 and 5.66), as well as lower MDA levels (by 0.12 and 0.15) and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> levels (by 0.44 and 0.55), respectively, in the ‘Atabaki’ and ‘Rabab’ cultivars. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the GRNN-NSGA-II model, as an advanced ML algorithm with a strong predictive ability for outcomes in combined stressful environmental conditions, provides valuable insights into the significant factors influencing such multifactorial processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Hydrogen Peroxide; Machine Learning; Malondialdehyde; Optimization Tool; Peroxidase; Protein; Γ-aminobutyric Acid; Hydrogen Peroxide; Superoxide Dismutase; Antioxidants; Hydrogen Peroxide; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase; Antioxidant; Hydrogen Peroxide; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Superoxide Dismutase; Drought; Pomegranate; Salt Stress; Antioxidants; Droughts; Hydrogen Peroxide; Pomegranate; Reactive Oxygen Species; Salt Stress; Superoxide Dismutase,antioxidant; hydrogen peroxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; drought; pomegranate; salt stress; Antioxidants; Droughts; Hydrogen Peroxide; Pomegranate; Reactive Oxygen Species; Salt Stress; Superoxide Dismutase,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85182859612

The availability of Remote Sensing (RS) datasets and Machine Learning (ML) approaches improved the prediction of sugarcane crop yield on the local and global scales, but an additional effort on the plot scale prediction is required. Challenges for plot-level prediction include a high ratooning capacity of the sugarcane crop, the lack of high spatial resolution data during the critical growth stages, and the non-linear complexation of yield data. The principal objective of the study is to analyse the potential of a time series of high-resolution multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery along with three advanced ML techniques, namely Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Artificial Neural Network (NARX ANN) as a solution to the plot-level sugarcane yield prediction. An experimental sugarcane field containing 48 plots was selected, and UAV imagery was collected during the three consecutive cropping seasons' early and middle crop growth stages. Each dataset per growth stage was analyzed separately to predict the sugarcane crop yield in an attempt to discover how early the prediction of pre-harvest yield can be achieved. The datasets of the first two cropping seasons were trained and tested using the three ML techniques, utilizing 10-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. The third cropping season dataset was then used to evaluate the reliability of the developed prediction models. The results show that the correlation of Vegetation Indices (VIs) with crop yield in the middle stage outperforms the early stage in all three ML models. Moreover, comparing these models indicates that the NARX ANN method outperformed the others in the middle stage with the highest correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.96 and the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.92 t/ha. It was followed by the SVR (R2 = 0.52, RMSE of 14.85 t/ha), which performed similarly to the RFR method (R2 = 0.48, RMSE = 11.20 t/ha). In conclusion, the best-suited model for predicting sugarcane yields during the middle growth stage is a NARX ANN model employing the Normalized Difference RedEdge (NDRE), which demonstrates the feasibility of the ML approaches to predict the plot level sugarcane yield at a specific period of growth as they are less sensitive to the inconsistency of data collection times. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Artificial Neural Network (narx Ann); Random Forest Regression (rfr); Sugarcane Yield Prediction; Support Vector Machine (svm); Antennas; Crops; Food Supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning Systems; Mean Square Error; Random Forests; Remote Sensing; Support Vector Regression; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Vectors; Auto-regressive; Crop Yield; Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Artificial Neural Network; Random Forest Regression; Sugarcane Yield; Sugarcane Yield Prediction; Support Vector Machine; Support Vectors Machine; Yield Prediction; Neural Networks; Aerial Photography; Crop Yield; Experimental Study; Food Security; Machine Learning; Multispectral Image; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Spatial Resolution; Sugar; Support Vector Machine; Unmanned Vehicle; Australia; Bundaberg; Queensland,Antennas; Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Mean square error; Random forests; Remote sensing; Support vector regression; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vectors; Auto-regressive; Crop yield; Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous artificial neural network; Random forest regression; Sugarcane yield; Sugarcane yield prediction; Support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Yield prediction; Neural networks; aerial photography; crop yield; experimental study; food security; machine learning; multispectral image; precision agriculture; remote sensing; spatial resolution; sugar; support vector machine; unmanned vehicle; Australia; Bundaberg; Queensland,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85170415324

However, the lack of research on the interaction between sNPs and plant cell walls has limited their application in these fields. Here, we designed Nile blue A-based sNPs (NB@G50-NPs) to investigate the penetration of small-sized sNPs (G50-NPs) through the plant cell wall. We demonstrate that 20 nm NB@G50-NPs can spontaneously cross the cell wall barrier and are rapidly taken up by Arabidopsis roots within a short time (30 min), showing nearly 10-fold higher fluorescence intensity compared to the free fluorescent dye. Additionally, the fluorescence quantum yield of NB@G50-NPs increases from 9% (for free dye) to 14%, and the particles show high stability across a broad pH range (3-10). This pH stability covers the entire pH range found in plant tissues.

Traditional methods of disease identification and severity assessment are often time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical, particularly in large production areas. In response to this challenge, researchers have recently turned to innovative solutions involving image processing and machine learning techniques for efficient disease detection in sugar beet plants. Image processing technology has emerged as a rapid and precise disease identification technology in sugar beet. By capitalizing on the ability of image processing to differentiate coloured objects, this approach facilitates the accurate determination of disease severity, enabling timely intervention measures. The urgency of developing faster and more practical methods becomes evident, highlighting the need to decrease human errors in identifying plant diseases and assessing their severity and progression. This review showcases the potential of image processing technology in revolutionizing disease detection strategies for sugar beet crops.

To highlight the ability of fungi to produce structurally diverse NPs, this article focuses on the impact of genome mining and CRISPR-Cas9 technology in uncovering and manipulating the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for NP synthesis. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, originally identified as a bacterial adaptive immune mechanism, has been adapted for precise genome editing in fungi, enabling targeted modifications, such as gene deletions, insertions, and transcription modulation, without altering the genomic sequence. This review elaborates on various CRISPR-Cas9 systems used in fungi, notably the Streptococcus pyogenes type II Cas9 system, and explores advancements in different Cas proteins for fungal genome editing. This review discusses the methodologies employed in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing of fungi, including guide RNA design, delivery methods, and verification of edited strains. The application of CRISPR-Cas9 has led to enhanced production of secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi, showcasing the potential of this system in biotechnology, medical mycology, and plant pathology. Moreover, this article emphasizes the integration of multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) to validate CRISPR-Cas9 editing effects in fungi. This comprehensive approach aids in understanding molecular changes, identifying off-target effects, and optimizing the editing protocols. Statistical and machine learning techniques are also crucial for analyzing multi-omics data, enabling the development of predictive models and identification of key molecular pathways affected by CRISPR-Cas9 editing.

High-spatial-resolution images (5 cm) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) were acquired using a Micasense Rededge-P camera and a DJI L1 sensor mounted on a drone. Precise locations of weeds were collected for calibration and validation. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived from multispectral images separated vegetation coverage and soil. A deep learning (DL) algorithm further classified vegetation coverage into sugarcane and weeds. The DL model performed well without overfitting. The classification accuracy was 87% compared to validation samples. The density and average heights of weed patches were extracted from the canopy height model (LiDAR).

Understanding the response of yield and lodging to the combined effects of climate, sugarcane traits, and varieties has become a priority under climate change. The aim of this study was to better understand the influence of plant characteristics, climate, and soil conditions on the trade-off between sugarcane yield and lodging on the tropical Reunion Island. Data from a 14-year experimental network run by the eRcane breeding institute were used to build random-forest models to predict sugarcane yield and lodging classes, i.e. <10 %, 10–50 %, >50 % of lodging. Yield and lodging probability were then predicted across the island using climate change projections from 2015 to 2035. Both yield and lodging were highly influenced by the variety and characteristics (height and tillering) and climatic conditions. Areas on the island at high altitudes were subject to high probability of lodging (>50 %), while in areas with high wind speed, the risk of moderate lodging (10–50 %) increased. Overall, conditions or plant characteristics that favor higher yields increased lodging probability. Nevertheless, the correlation between yield and lodging probability varied considerably depending on the variety, highlighting the importance of sugarcane characteristics in resistance to lodging. This study highlights the fact that promoting more productive varieties in recent decades has led to an increase in lodging and identified critical environments on the island prone to increased risk of lodging. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Lodging; Machine Learning; Saccharum Spp.; Tropics; Yield; Altitude; Climate Change; Crop Yield; Plant Breeding; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sugar Cane; Trade-off; Tropical Environment; Mascarene Islands; Reunion,altitude; climate change; crop yield; plant breeding; spatiotemporal analysis; sugar cane; trade-off; tropical environment; Mascarene Islands; Reunion,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205989765

In this study, Raman spectroscopy was employed to develop an early diagnosis model by integrating support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and convolutional neural network (CNN) modeling techniques. The effects of various pretreatment methods and combinations of methods on modeling results were studied. The relative optimal index formula was utilized to identify the SG and SG+WT as the most effective preprocessing methods. Following the optimal preprocessing method, the performance of the majority of the models was markedly enhanced through the process of model reconditioning, among which XGBoost achieved 80% accuracy under SG+WT pretreatment, and F1 and kappa both performed best. The results show that RF, GBDT, and XGBoost are more sensitive to the pretreatment method, whereas SVM and CNN are more dependent on internal parameter tuning. The results of this study indicate that the early detection of Raman spectroscopy represents a novel approach for the nondestructive identification of asymptomatic ‘Akizuki’ pear corky disease, which is of paramount importance for the realization of large-scale detection across orchards. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corky Disease; Nondestructive Testing; Raman Spectroscopy; ‘akizuki’ Pear; Adaptive Boosting; Decision Trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Support Vector Machines; Convolutional Neural Network; Corky Disease; Gradient Boosting; Non Destructive; Nondestructive Detection; Pre-processing Method; Pretreatment Methods; Random Forests; Support Vectors Machine; ‘akizuki’ Pear; Raman Spectroscopy; Algorithm; Artificial Neural Network; Chemistry; Fruit; Plant Disease; Procedures; Pyrus; Raman Spectrometry; Support Vector Machine; Algorithms; Fruit; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Diseases; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Support Vector Machine","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Support vector machines; Convolutional neural network; Corky disease; Gradient boosting; Non destructive; Nondestructive detection; Pre-processing method; Pretreatment methods; Random forests; Support vectors machine; ‘akizuki’ pear; Raman spectroscopy; algorithm; artificial neural network; chemistry; fruit; plant disease; procedures; Pyrus; Raman spectrometry; support vector machine; Algorithms; Fruit; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Diseases; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Support Vector Machine",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206294021

In this work, we aimed to identify the genetic basis of metabolite functions during harsh environmental conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana. With machine learning algorithms we predicted stress-specific metabolomes for 23 (a)biotic stress phenotypes of 300 natural Arabidopsis accessions. The prediction models identified several aliphatic glucosinolates (GLSs) and their breakdown products to be implicated in responses to heat stress in siliques and herbivory by Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. Bivariate GWA mapping of the metabolome predictions and their respective (a)biotic stress phenotype revealed genetic associations with MAM, AOP, and GS-OH, all three involved in aliphatic GSL biosynthesis. We, therefore, investigated thrips herbivory on AOP, MAM, and GS-OH loss-of-function and/or overexpression lines. Arabidopsis accessions with a combination of MAM2 and AOP3, leading to 3-hydroxypropyl dominance, suffered less from thrips feeding damage. The requirement of MAM2 for this effect could, however, not be confirmed with an introgression line of ecotypes Cvi and Ler, most likely due to other, unknown susceptibility factors in the Ler background. However, AOP2 and GS-OH, adding alkenyl or hydroxy-butenyl groups, respectively, did not have major effects on thrips feeding. Overall, this study illustrates the complex implications of aliphatic GSL diversity in plant responses to heat stress and a cell-content-feeding herbivore. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",(a)biotic Stresses; Aop; Mam; Metabolomics; Quantitative Genetics; Arabidopsis Proteins; Glucosinolates; Cell Culture; Plant Diseases; (a)biotic Stress; Aop; Biotic Stress; Bivariate; Glucosinolates; Heat Stress; Mam; Metabolomics; Plant Response; Quantitative Genetic; Metabolites; Biosynthesis; Breakdown; Feeding; Heat; Mapping; Organizations; Plants; Stresses; Arabidopsis Protein; Glucosinolate; Animal; Arabidopsis; Chromosomal Mapping; Genetics; Heat Shock Response; Herbivory; Metabolism; Metabolome; Phenotype; Physiology; Thysanoptera; Animals; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chromosome Mapping; Heat-shock Response; Herbivory; Metabolome; Phenotype,Cell culture; Plant diseases; (a)biotic stress; AOP; Biotic stress; Bivariate; Glucosinolates; Heat stress; MAM; Metabolomics; Plant response; Quantitative genetic; Metabolites; Biosynthesis; Breakdown; Feeding; Heat; Mapping; Organizations; Plants; Stresses; Arabidopsis protein; glucosinolate; animal; Arabidopsis; chromosomal mapping; genetics; heat shock response; herbivory; metabolism; metabolome; phenotype; physiology; Thysanoptera; Animals; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chromosome Mapping; Heat-Shock Response; Herbivory; Metabolome; Phenotype,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204763297

However, more attention is needed, particularly regarding the content and concentration of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), especially in the context of climate change (CC) impacts. To address this, various controlled field experiments were conducted, involving the cultivation of three wheat cultivars over three growing seasons at multiple locations with different soil and climate conditions under varying Fe and Zn treatments. The yield and yield attributes, including nutritional values such as nitrogen (N), Fe and Zn, from these experiments were integrated with national yield statistics from other locations to train and test different machine learning (ML) algorithms. Automated ML leveraging a large number of models, outperformed traditional ML models, enabling the training and testing of numerous models, and achieving robust predictions of grain yield (GY) (R2 > 0.78), N (R2 > 0.75), Fe (R2 > 0.71) and Zn (R2 > 0.71) through a stacked ensemble of all models. The ensemble model predicted GY, N, Fe, and Zn at spatial explicit in the mid-century (2020-2050) using three Global Circulation Models (GCMs): GFDL-ESM4, HadGEM3-GC31-MM, and MRI-ESM2-0 under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) specifically SSP2-45 and SSP5-85, from the downscaled NEX-GDDP-CMIP6. Averaged across different GCMs and SSPs, CC is projected to increase wheat yield by 4.5%, and protein concentration by 0.8% with high variability. However, it is expected to decrease Fe concentration by 5.5%, and Zn concentration by 4.5% in the mid-century (2020-2050) relative to the historical period (1980-2010).

However, the black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis), although less consumed, is resistant to one of the most important diseases for the crop, the late leaf rust caused by Acculeastrum americanum fungus. In this context, genetic resistance is the most sustainable way to control the disease, mainly because there are no registered fungicides for late leaf rust in Brazil. Therefore, the aim was to understand the genetic architecture that controls resistance to late leaf rust in raspberries. For that, we used an interspecific multiparental population using the species mentioned above as parents, 2 different statistical approaches to associate the phenotypes with markers [GWAS (genome-wide association studies) and copula graphical models], and 2 phenotyping methodologies from the first to the 17th day after inoculation (high-throughput phenotyping with a multispectral camera and traditional phenotyping by disease severity scores). Our findings indicate that a locus of higher effect, at position 13.3 Mb on chromosome 5, possibly controls late leaf rust resistance, as both GWAS and the network suggested the same marker. Of the 12 genes flanking its region, 4 were possible receptors, 3 were likely defense executors, 1 gene was likely part of signaling cascades, and 4 were classified as nondefense related. Although the network and GWAS indicated the same higher effect genomic region, the network identified other different candidate regions, potentially complementing the genetic control comprehension. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acculeastrum Americanum; Copula Graphical Models Network; Genomic; Gwas; High-throughput Phenotyping; Plant Genetics; Rubus Sp; Abc Transporter Subfamily B; Protein; Protein Serine Threonine Kinase; Abc Transporter Subfamily B; Broad Spectrum Mildew Resistance Protein; Fungicide; L Type Lectin Domain Containing Receptor Kinase; Leucine Rich Repeat Receptor Protein Kinase Ems1; Nb Arc Domain Disease Resistance Protein; Protein; Protein Serine Threonine Kinase; Salicylic Acid Binding Protein 2; Unclassified Drug; Wall Associated Receptor Kinase Like 21; Wrky Transcription Factor 2; Acculeastrum Americanum; Article; Brazil; Chromosome 5; Disease Exacerbation; Disease Severity; Fungus; Genetic Regulation; Genetic Resistance; Genetic Variation; Genome-wide Association Study; Image Processing; Interspecific Hybrid; Leaf Rust; Methodology; Nonhuman; Phenotypic Variation; Population; Raspberry; Basidiomycetes; Chromosomal Mapping; Disease Resistance; Genetics; Microbiology; Phenotype; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Quantitative Trait Locus; Rubus; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Basidiomycota; Chromosome Mapping; Disease Resistance; Genome-wide Association Study; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci","ABC transporter subfamily B; broad spectrum mildew resistance protein; fungicide; l type lectin domain containing receptor kinase; leucine rich repeat receptor protein kinase ems1; nb arc domain disease resistance protein; protein; protein serine threonine kinase; salicylic acid binding protein 2; unclassified drug; wall associated receptor kinase like 21; wrky transcription factor 2; Acculeastrum americanum; Article; Brazil; chromosome 5; disease exacerbation; disease severity; fungus; genetic regulation; genetic resistance; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; image processing; interspecific hybrid; leaf rust; methodology; nonhuman; phenotypic variation; population; raspberry; Basidiomycetes; chromosomal mapping; disease resistance; genetics; microbiology; phenotype; plant disease; plant leaf; quantitative trait locus; Rubus; single nucleotide polymorphism; Basidiomycota; Chromosome Mapping; Disease Resistance; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85203050124

Additionally, they are an excellent source of protein for both human consumption and animal feed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), found in various leguminous seeds, exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity through diverse mechanisms, including interaction with microbial cell membranes and interference with cellular processes, making them valuable for enhancing crop resilience and food safety. In the field of plant sciences, computational biology methods have been instrumental in the discovery and optimization of AMPs. These methods enable rapid exploration of sequence space and the prediction of AMPs using deep learning technologies. Optimizing AMP annotations through computational design offers a strategic approach to enhance efficacy and minimize potential side effects, providing a viable alternative to conventional antimicrobial agents. However, the presence of overlapping sequences across multiple databases poses a challenge for creating a reliable dataset for AMP prediction. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sequence redundancy across various AMP databases. These databases encompass a wide range of AMPs from different sources and with specific functions, including both naturally occurring and artificially synthesized AMPs. Our analysis revealed significant overlap, underscoring the need for a non-redundant AMP sequence database. We present the development of a new database that consolidates unique AMP sequences derived from leguminous seeds, aiming to create a more refined dataset for the binary classification and prediction of plant-derived AMPs. This database will support the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices by enhancing the use of plant-based AMPs in agroecology, contributing to improved crop protection and food security. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Antimicrobial Peptides (amps); Computational Biology; Database Analysis; Plant; Sequence Redundancy; Nitrogen Fixation; Peptides; Antimicrobial Peptide; Atmospheric Nitrogen; Computational Biology; Database Analysis; Leguminous Crops; Peptide Sequences; Plant; Sequence Redundancy; Sustainable Agriculture; Plant Diseases,Nitrogen fixation; Peptides; Antimicrobial peptide; Atmospheric nitrogen; Computational biology; Database analysis; Leguminous crops; Peptide sequences; Plant; Sequence redundancy; Sustainable agriculture; Plant diseases,Data paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202059851

The advancement of deep learning algorithms in precision agriculture holds the key to enabling the early classification of plant diseases, thereby leading to enhanced crop yields and ultimately stabilizing food security. In the coarse-grained label discrimination task of weak supervision learning, high-quality semantic features contain abundant semantic description information, which plays a crucial role in constructing a precise description of plant disease discrimination in tanglesome field circumstances and directly influences the performance of neural networks. Thus, a multiattention IBN anti-aliasing neural network (MAIANet) was proposed to improve the classification accuracy of cassava leaf disease classification by improving the feature quality in the coarseness label classification task. The proposed MAIANet neural network includes two innovative approaches. First, the multiattention method was designed to scale the feature signals twice to adjust the angular frequency of the feature signals in the residual branch for optimal feature fitting within the residual unit. Second, the anti-aliasing block extracts the high-frequency component feature and optimizes the quantization result of the pooling operation to depress the aliasing signal in the down-sampled feature maps. When the proposed method was tested and validated on the cassava dataset, the results showed that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method significantly improved, with an accuracy of 95.83 %, a loss of 1.720, and an F1-score of 0.9585, outperforming V2-ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B5, RepVGG-B3g4, and AlexNet with significant margins.

However, due to the lack of reliable information, particularly concerning soil variability, these models have shown limited performance for specific analyses. This study aims to evaluate Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) as an alternative for filling soil data gaps in crop modeling and to assess the influence of these products on prediction uncertainties. The study site is located in Piracicaba region, Southern Brazil. Methods: The framework was: (i) a legacy soil data were utilized, and equal-spline equations were applied to standardize the dataset.; (ii) a machine learning (ML) algorithm was used to predict soil attributes and their uncertainties; (iii) pedotransfer functions were applied to obtain soil hydrological properties; (iv) DSSAT/CANEGRO crop model was used to estimate sugarcane yield; (iv) a legacy soil map (LSM), SoilGrids (SG) and a map of attributes derived from regional DSM (RDSM) were compared; (v) a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) was conducted with the RDSM maps to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in the estimation of sugarcane yield. Results: The DSM proved to be a reliable source for use in crop models, reaching similar results to field data. The sugarcane yield map emphasized the model’s sensitivity to soil attributes, with texture and depth significantly impacting yield estimations. Conclusion: In this sense, coupling DSM and crop modeling is a feasible way to improve yield estimates, especially in countries with limited soil databases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dssat/canegro; Grid Yield Estimation; Monte Carlo Simulations; Spatial Soil Variability; Agricultural Modeling; Algorithm; Crop Yield; Digital Mapping; Estimation Method; Machine Learning; Monte Carlo Analysis; Simulation; Soil Analysis; Spatial Analysis; Spatial Variation; Sugar Cane; Water Stress; Brazil; Piracicaba; Sao Paulo [brazil],agricultural modeling; algorithm; crop yield; digital mapping; estimation method; machine learning; Monte Carlo analysis; simulation; soil analysis; spatial analysis; spatial variation; sugar cane; water stress; Brazil; Piracicaba; Sao Paulo [Brazil],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188346328

The forest fruits have been ever-increasingly produced annually. However, it is a high demand for the high-quality forest products, as living standards rise. Accurate assessment of fruit quality can dominate food safety to optimize the transportation and storage for the subsequent grading. Therefore, it is necessary to develop rapid, accurate, and non-destructive quality detection for forest fruits. Particularly, deep learning has been widely applied in the non-destructive quality detection of forest fruits in recent years, due to the automatic features extraction, wide applicability, and end-to-end learning. This review was focused on the research progress of deep learning in forest fruit quality from three aspects: safety, external and internal quality. It was found that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were the most widely used deep learning models in the field of non-destructive quality detection of forest fruits. However, several challenges still remained, including data quality, generalization, and practical implementation. Therefore, some recommendations were then proposed for further application of deep learning. The publicly available datasets should be established to validate the model performance. Future endeavors should explore the application of deep learning-based data augmentation to generate spectral data, beyond only image datasets. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaboration should be fostered to combine microbiology, insect ecology, and plant pathology. Furthermore, standardized evaluation metrics should be developed to validate the scientific soundness of deep learning models, in order to generate various pest and disease data. In terms of models, meta-learning can be expected to design models that can adapt and improve learning strategies. Some challenges are to overcome the influences of origin, batch, environment, and variety on the accuracy of the model. Since most existing studies have been focused mainly on the high model accuracy in recent years, only a little attention can be given to model runtime and detection efficiency. Consequently, a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency should be explored to develop lightweight models. Moreover, the deep fusion of multiple models is crucial to leverage their respective strengths. In terms of applications, quantitative studies can be concentrated on the severity of fruit pests, diseases, mechanical damage, and appearance defects using semantic segmentation. The time detection of pest infection and mechanical damage occurrence can be improved to increase the collection time and frequency, in order to improve the database for model training. Future research on forest fruit flavors should also be emphasized to facilitate consumer choice. Since deep learning is mostly confined to the laboratory stage, adequate attention can be received in practical production. Therefore, there is a high demand to integrate industry, academia, and research for the intelligent assessment equipment of fruit quality. Some insights can be provided for the further development of deep learning in non-destructive fruit quality assessment, particularly in the digitalization of the fruit industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Forest Fruits; Non-destructive Detection; Quality Assurance; Diseases; Failure Analysis; Forest Ecology; Plant Diseases; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Forest Fruit; Fruit Industry; Fruit Quality; High Demand; Learning Models; Non Destructive; Nondestructive Detection; Quality Detection; Fruits,Diseases; Failure analysis; Forest ecology; Plant diseases; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Forest fruit; Fruit industry; Fruit quality; High demand; Learning models; Non destructive; Nondestructive detection; Quality detection; Fruits,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212314834

Their application enables the support for sustainable agricultural practices and the formulation of effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Farmers can apply the maps to gain an overview of the yield variability, improving farm management practices and optimizing inputs to increase productivity and sustainability such as fertilizers. Earth observation (EO) data make it possible to map crop yield estimations over large areas, although this will remain challenging for specific crops such as sugarcane. Yield data collection is an expensive and time-consuming practice that often limits the number of samples collected. In this study, the sugarcane yield estimation based on a small number of training datasets within smallholder crop systems in the Tha Khan Tho District, Thailand for the year 2022 was assessed. Specifically, multi-temporal satellite datasets from multiple sensors, including Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9, were involved. Moreover, in order to generate the sugarcane yield estimation maps, only 75 sampling plots were selected and surveyed to provide training and validation data for several powerful machine-learning algorithms, including multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise multiple regression (SMR), partial least squares regression (PLS), random forest regression (RFR), and support vector regression (SVR). Among these algorithms, the RFR model demonstrated outstanding performance, yielding an excellent result compared to existing techniques, achieving an R-squared (R2) value of 0.79 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.93 t/ha (per 10 m × 10 m pixel). Furthermore, the mapped yields across the region closely aligned with the official statistical data from the Office of the Cane and Sugar Board (with a range value of 36,000 ton). Finally, the sugarcane yield estimation model was applied to over 2100 sugarcane fields in order to provide an overview of the current state of the yield and total production in the area. In this work, the different yield rates at the field level were highlighted, providing a powerful workflow for mapping sugarcane yields across large regions, supporting sugarcane crop management and facilitating decision-making processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Earth Observation; Landsat; Machine Learning; Sentinel-2; Sugarcane; Yield Estimation; Agricultural Practice; Algorithm; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Estimation Method; Landsat; Machine Learning; Satellite Data; Sentinel; Sugar Cane; Thailand,agricultural practice; algorithm; crop production; crop yield; estimation method; Landsat; machine learning; satellite data; Sentinel; sugar cane; Thailand,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205287787

Leaf diseases caused by climate change and other factors have significantly reduced fruit production. Deep learning methods for segmenting leaf diseases can effectively mitigate this issue. However, challenges such as leaf folding, jaggedness, and light shading make edge feature extraction difficult, affecting segmentation accuracy. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method based on EFS-Former. The expanded local detail (ELD) module extends the model’s receptive field by expanding the convolution, better handling fine spots and effectively reducing information loss. H-attention reduces computational redundancy by superimposing multi-layer convolutions, significantly improving feature filtering. The parallel fusion architecture effectively utilizes the different feature extraction intervals of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer encoders, achieving comprehensive feature extraction and effectively fusing detailed and semantic information in the channel and spatial dimensions within the feature fusion module (FFM). Experiments show that, compared to DeepLabV3+, this method achieves 10.78%, 9.51%, 0.72%, and 8.00% higher scores for mean intersection over union (mIoU), mean pixel accuracy (mPA), accuracy (Acc), and F_score, respectively, while having 1.78 M fewer total parameters and 0.32 G lower floating point operations per second (FLOPS). Additionally, it effectively calculates the ratio of leaf area occupied by spots. This method is also effective in calculating the disease period by analyzing the ratio of leaf area occupied by diseased spots. The method’s overall performance is evaluated using mIoU, mPA, Acc, and F_score metrics, achieving 88.60%, 93.49%, 98.60%, and 95.90%, respectively. In summary, this study offers an efficient and accurate method for fruit tree leaf spot segmentation, providing a solid foundation for the precise analysis of fruit tree leaves and spots, and supporting smart agriculture for precision pesticide spraying. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cnn; H-attention; Leaf Diseases Detection; Parallel Fusion Architecture; Smart Agriculture,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205069619

Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), a causal agent of diseases of economically important citrus species, shows intrinsic genetic stability. While the virus appears to have some mechanism that limits the accumulation of single-nucleotide variants, the production of defective viral genomes (DVGs) during virus infection has been reported for certain variants of CTV. The intra-host diversity generated during plant infection with variant T36 (CTV-T36) remains unclear. To address this, we analyzed the RNA species accumulated in the initially infected and systemic leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana plants inoculated with an infectious cDNA clone of CTV-T36, which warranted that infection was initiated by a known, well-defined sequence variant of the virus. CTV-T36 limited the accumulation of single-nucleotide mutants during infection. With that, four types of DVGs—deletions, insertions, and copy- and snap-backs—were found in all the samples, with deletions and insertions being the most common types. Hot-spots across the genome for DVG recombination and short direct sequence repeats suggest that sequence complementarity could mediate DVG formation. In conclusion, our study illustrates the formation of diverse DVGs during CTV-T36 infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has analyzed the genetic variability and recombination of a well-defined sequence variant of CTV in an herbaceous host. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Citrus Tristeza Virus; Defective Viral Genomes; Intra-host Population Diversity; Kanamycin; Rifampicin; Rna, Viral; Directzol Rna Miniprep Plus Kit; Truseq Stranded Total Rna With Ribo-zero Plant; Ultraviolet Lamp; Green Fluorescent Protein; Kanamycin; Reagent; Rifampicin; Viral Protein; Virus Rna; Agrobacterium Tumefaciens; Article; Capsicum Annuum; Citrus Tristeza Virus; Controlled Study; Cucurbita Pepo; Error; Genome Analysis; Machine Learning; Nicotiana Benthamiana; Nicotiana Tabacum; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Sequence; Open Reading Frame; Rna Extraction; Rna Recombination; Rna Sequence; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis; Sequence Homology; Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus; Virus Genome; Virus Infection; Virus Replication; Citrus; Classification; Closterovirus; Genetic Variation; Genetics; Nicotiana; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Virology; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Rna, Viral","green fluorescent protein; kanamycin; reagent; rifampicin; viral protein; virus RNA; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Article; Capsicum annuum; Citrus tristeza virus; controlled study; Cucurbita pepo; error; genome analysis; machine learning; Nicotiana benthamiana; Nicotiana tabacum; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; RNA extraction; RNA recombination; RNA sequence; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; sequence homology; Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus; virus genome; virus infection; virus replication; Citrus; classification; Closterovirus; genetic variation; genetics; Nicotiana; plant disease; plant leaf; virology; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; RNA, Viral",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205040555

The survival tactics of both pathogens and hosts depend on intricate interactions between host plants and pathogenic microbes. Iron-binding proteins (IBPs) and copper-binding proteins (CBPs) play a crucial role in these interactions by participating in enzyme reactions, virulence, metabolism, and transport processes. We employed high-throughput computational tools at the sequence and structural levels to investigate the IBPs and CBPs of F. oxysporum. A total of 124 IBPs and 37 CBPs were identified in the proteome of Fusarium. The ranking of amino acids based on their affinity for binding with iron is Glu > His> Asp > Asn > Cys, and for copper is His > Asp > Cys respectively. The functional annotation, determination of subcellular localization, and Gene Ontology analysis of these putative IBPs and CBPs have unveiled their potential involvement in a diverse array of cellular and biological processes. Three iron-binding glycosyl hydrolase family proteins, along with four CBPs with carbohydrate-binding domains, have been identified as potential effector candidates. These proteins are distinct from the host Solanum lycopersicum proteome. Moreover, they are known to be located extracellularly and function as enzymes that degrade the host cell wall during pathogen–host interactions.

Pathogen effector proteins are central players in such disease development. On one hand, they improve susceptibility by manipulating host targets; on the other hand, they can trigger immunity after recognition by host immune receptors. A major research direction in the study of molecular plant pathology is to understand effector-host interactions, which has informed the development and breeding of crops with enhanced disease resistance. Recent breakthroughs on experiment- and artificial intelligence-based structure analyses significantly accelerate the development of this research area. Importantly, the detailed molecular insight of effector–host interactions enables precise engineering to mitigate disease. Here, we highlight a recent study by Xiao et al., who describe the structure of an effector-receptor complex that consists of a fungal effector, with polygalacturonase (PG) activity, and a plant-derived polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP). PGs weaken the plant cell wall and produce immune-suppressive oligogalacturonides (OGs) as a virulence mechanism; however, PGIPs directly bind to PGs and alter their enzymatic activity. When in a complex with PGIPs, PGs produce OG polymers with longer chains that can trigger immunity. Xiao et al. demonstrate that a PGIP creates a new active site tunnel, together with a PG, which favors the production of long-chain OGs. In this way, the PGIP essentially acts as both a PG receptor and enzymatic manipulator, converting virulence to defense activation. Taking a step forward, the authors used the PG-PGIP complex structure as a guide to generate PGIP variants with enhanced long-chain OG production, likely enabling further improved disease resistance. This study discovered a novel mechanism by which a plant receptor plays a dual role to activate immunity. It also demonstrates how fundamental knowledge, obtained through structural analyses, can be employed to guide the design of proteins with desired functions in agriculture. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bioengineering; Cell Wall-degrading Enzymes; Plant Immunity; Receptor Biology; Structural Biology,,Editorial,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189961803

The major six general grape leaf diseases and pests are brown spots, leaf blight, downy mildew, anthracnose, and black rot. However, the existing manual detection methods are time-consuming and require more efforts. In this paper, an effectual grape leaf disease finding and percentage of pesticide detection approach is devised usingan optimized deep learning scheme. Here, the input image is pre-processed and then, black spot segmentation is done using proposed Taylor Remora Optimization Procedure (TROA). The TROA is the combination of Taylor concept and Remora Optimization Algorithm (ROA). After that, the multi-classification of grape leaf disease is performed to classify the disease as Black rot, Black measles, Isariopsis leaf spot and healthy. Accordingly, the training process of the Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Optimizer (DNFN) is done using Sine Cosine Butterfly Optimization (SCBO). Then, pesticide classification is done using Deep Maxout Network (DMN) and the training of the DMN is done using the Monarch Anti Corona Optimization (MACO) algorithm.

Cassava leaf disease is the major issue which affects production. Automatic early cassava leaf disease detection through deep learning models and transfer learning models were used for multiclass classification with different approaches. Existing approaches deal with imbalanced dataset for predicting the classes. This research work develops an approach based on hybrid Ensemble - deep transfer model approach for early leaf disease detection. Data augmentation was applied to the raw data for balancing the dataset. Three distinct new hybrid models namely Ensemble(InceptionV3+DenseNet-BC-121-32 + Xception), Ensemble(ResNet50V2+DenseNet-BC-121-32), Ensemble(ResNet50V2+ResNet50) were developed. The proposed model shows high performance results. A broad comparison of the proposed model was performed with custom based Convolutional Neural Network and pre-trained models.

Farmers need healthy soil and natural minerals for traditional farming, and production takes a little longer time. The soil-free farming method known as vertical farming (VF) requires a small land and consumes a very small amount of water than conventional soil-dependent farming techniques. With modern technologies like hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, the notion of the VF appears to have a promising future in urban areas where farming land is very expensive and scarce. VF faces difficulty in the simultaneous monitoring of multiple indicators, nutrition advice, and plant diagnosis systems. However, these issues can be resolved by implementing current technical advancements like artificial intelligence (AI)-based control techniques such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), the internet of things (IoT), image processing as well as computer vision. This article presents a thorough analysis of ML and IoT applications in VF system. The areas on which the attention is concentrated include disease detection, crop yield prediction, nutrition, and irrigation control management. In order to predict crop yield and crop diseases, the computer vision technique is investigated in view of the classification of distinct collections of crop images. This article also illustrates ML and IoT-based VF systems that can raise product quality and production over the long term. Assessment and evaluation of the knowledge-based VF system have also been outlined in the article with the potential outcomes, advantages, and limitations of ML and IoT in the VF system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Disease Detection; Hydroponics; Iot; Machine Learning; Vertical Farming; Yield Prediction,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199497170

One example is site-specific fertilization based on accurate monitoring of soil nutrient levels, which can be made more cost-effective using sensors. This study developed an impedimetric multisensor array using ion-selective membranes to analyze soil samples enriched with macronutrients (N, P, and K), which is compared with another array based on layer-by-layer films. The results obtained from both devices are analyzed with multidimensional projection techniques and machine learning methods, where a decision tree model algorithm chooses the calibrations (best frequencies and sensors). The multicalibration space method indicates that both devices effectively distinguished all soil samples tested, with the ion-selective membrane setup presenting a higher sensitivity to K content.

They also contribute to ecosystem services, such as nitrogen fixation and resilience to environmental stresses. Despite a 60% increase in global pulse production from 2000 to 2021, a demand-supply gap, especially in South Asia, raises concerns about nutritional access. Since illnesses are currently an issue to the food security of faba beans, machine learning is required for efficient disease identification. Methods: This research employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust Faba bean leaf disease identification. The CNN model is trained with diverse images representing specific diseases.

In Indonesia, the soil and climate create favorable conditions for apple cultivation. However, it is essential to prioritize the health of the plant. Biotic factors, such as fungal infections like apple scabs and pests, alongside abiotic factors like temperature and soil moisture, impact the health of apple plants. Computer vision, specifically convolution neural network (CNN) inception-V3, proves effective in aiding farmers in identifying these diseases. The output layer in inception-V3 is essential, generating predictions based on input data. For this reason, in this paper, we add an output layer in inception-V3 architecture to increase the accuracy of apple leaf disease classification. The added output layers are dense, dropout, and batch normalization. Adding a dense layer after flattening typically consolidates the extracted features into a more compact representation. Dropout can help prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating some units during training. Batch normalization helps normalize activations across batches, speeding up training and providing stability to the model. Test results show that the proposed method produced an accuracy of 99.27% and can increase accuracy by 1.85% compared to inception-V3.

Although plant tissue analysis has conventionally been employed to evaluate the nutritional status of crops, this method cannot capture the spatial variability of crop nutrients. In contrast, satellite-based remote sensing can monitor the nutrient status of crops across expansive areas. This study explored the capability of multi-source satellite images (PlanetScope-4: 3 m, 4 bands; PlanetScope-8: 3 m, 8 bands; Sentinel-2: 10–60 m, 13 bands; PRISMA: 30 m, 239 bands) in mapping 12 foliar nutrients in cranberries. Three machine learning approaches, including partial least squared regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), were used to relate foliar nutrients to different types of satellite-derived features (SR: surface reflectance; VI: vegetation indices; TF: texture features) or their combinations (SR+VI, VI+TF and SR+VI+TF). Model performance was compared across different foliar nutrients, modelling approaches and combinations of model input features using R2 (the coefficient of determination) and RRMSE (relative root mean square error, = root mean square error/nutrient range × 100 %). Input features that were important to foliar nutrient modelling were identified. The model performance difference among nutrients was consistent between Planet-4 and Sentinel-2, as well as between Planet-8 and PRISMA. In the Planet-4 and Sentinel-2 derived models, N was best predicted (average R2 = 0.77, average RRMSE=15 %), followed by macronutrients S (0.60–0.63, 11 %), Mg (0.58–0.65, 10–11 %), Ca (0.49–0.51, 9 %), Na (0.69, 22 %), P (0.49, 9 %) and K (0.20, 8 %), and then by all micronutrients(i.e., Fe, Mn, B, Cu and Zn: R2 = 0.04–0.61; RRMSE=16–28 %). In the Planet-8 and PRISMA derived models, macronutrients (i.e., N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S and Na) had lower R2 and RRMSE (R2 = 0.06–0.59; RRMSE=7–57 %) than micronutrients (i.e., Fe, Mn, B, Cu and Zn: R2 = 0.18–0.60; RRMSE=19–66 %). The successful retrieval of foliar nutrients from satellite imagery was influenced by many factors, including the intercorrelation between nutrients and model input features, the data availability at critical growth stages, and satellite images characteristics (e.g., spatial and spectral resolutions). Except for foliar nitrogen, foliar nutrients typically do not exhibit distinct absorption features associated with C, H, N, or O molecular bonds in the 400–2500 nm range. Our results indicate that their successful retrieval can be primarily attributed to the association between foliar nutrients and other leaf components (e.g., pigments, water, and dry matter) that do display spectral features within this range. Our study demonstrated the potential of integrating multi-source satellite data for precise nutrient monitoring over large scales. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Foliar Nutrients; Machine Learning; Multi-source Satellite Remote Sensing; Precision Nutrient Management; Crop; Machine Learning; Nutrient; Remote Sensing; Satellite Data; United States; Wisconsin,crop; machine learning; nutrient; remote sensing; satellite data; United States; Wisconsin,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200458670

It is a major source of vegetable oil and protein for human consumption, as well as a cash crop for farmers in many regions. Despite the importance of this crop to household food security and income, diseases, particularly Leaf spot (early and late), Alternaria leaf spot, Rust, and Rosette, have had a significant impact on its production. Deep learning (DL) techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated significant ability for early diagnosis of the plant leaf diseases. However, the availability of groundnut-specific datasets for training and evaluation of DL models is limited, hindering the development and benchmarking of groundnut-related deep learning applications. Therefore, this study provides a dataset of groundnut leaf images, both diseased and healthy, captured in real cultivation fields at Ramchandrapur, Purba Medinipur, West Bengal, using a smartphone camera.

The use of N simulation models of the soil-plant system can help improve the N fertilizer management increasing NUE and decreasing N pollution issues. However, many N simulation models lack balance between complexity and uncertainty with the result that they are not applied in actual practice. The NITIRSOIL is a one-dimensional transient-state model with a monthly time step that aims at addressing this lack in the estimation of, mainly, dry matter yield (DMY), crop N uptake (N<inf>upt</inf>), soil mineral N (N<inf>min</inf>), and NO<inf>3</inf>− leaching in agricultural fields. According to its global sensitivity analysis for horticulture, the NITIRSOIL simulations of the aforementioned outputs mostly depend on the critical N dilution curve, harvest index, dry matter fraction, potential fresh yield and nitrification coefficients. According to its validation for 35 nitrogen fertilization trials with 11 vegetables under semi-arid Mediterranean climate in Eastern Spain, the NITIRSOIL presents indices of agreement between 0.87 and 0.97 for the prediction of total dry matter, DMY, N<inf>upt</inf>, NO<inf>3</inf>− leaching and soil N<inf>min</inf> at crop season end. Therefore, the NITIRSOIL model can be used in actual practice to improve the sustainability of the N management in, particularly horticulture, due to the balance it features between complexity and prediction uncertainty.

This study explores the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predicting apple plant diseases in orchards. By leveraging advanced computational techniques, the research aims to enhance early detection and diagnosis of diseases, thereby enabling proactive disease management. The study utilizes a dataset comprising diverse environmental and plant health factors to train and validate the models. Key highlights include the comparative analysis of machine learning and deep learning approaches, the identification of optimal feature sets, and the assessment of model performance. The findings contribute to the development of efficient and accurate tools for precision agriculture, facilitating timely intervention and sustainable orchard management. The apple industry in Kashmir faces a significant challenge due to the prevalence of various diseases affecting apple trees. One prominent disease that adversely impacts apple yields in the region is the Apple Scab, caused by the fungus Venturia inadequacies. Apple Scab is characterized by dark, scaly lesions on leaves, fruit, and twigs, leading to defoliation and reduced fruit quality. The disease thrives in cool and humid conditions, which are prevalent in the Kashmir Valley. This study addresses the limitations of traditional, labor-intensive, and time-consuming laboratory methods for diagnosing apple plant diseases. The goal is to provide an accurate and efficient deep learning-based system for the prompt identification and prediction of foliar diseases in Kashmiri apple plants. Our study begins involves the creation of a dataset annotated by experts containing approximately 10,000 high-quality RGB images that illustrate key symptoms associated with foliar diseases. In the next step, an approach to deep learning that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was developed. Comparative analysis five different deep learning algorithms, including Faster R-CNN, showed that the method was effective in detecting apple diseases in real time. The proposed framework, when tested, achieves state-of-the-art results with a remarkable 92% accuracy in identifying apple plant diseases. A new dataset is presented that includes samples of leaves from Kashmiri apple plants that have three different illnesses. The findings hold promise for revolutionizing orchard management practices, ultimately benefiting apple growers and sustaining the thriving apple industry in the Kashmir Valley. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Apple Disease Classification; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Machine Learning,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197425653

The different varieties of pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, pests, insects, etc. are the major causes of crop loss. So, the implementation of biosensors in the field of agriculture can be a beneficial tool to solve this problem. Biosensors can help to promote sustainable food production by the early detection of pathogens, fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, moisture, and diseases in crops and animals, as well as the presence of heavy metal ions, and toxins. Additionally, it can also help to measure the different parameters including soil pH, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic content, protein content, and total nutrient uptake (macronutrients and micronutrients) by the plants, etc. With the implementation of these biosensors, farmers can increase crop yields, optimize fertilization techniques, and preserve resources by detecting and measuring particular nutrients. The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology greatly transforms the state of traditional agriculture by addressing various challenges, such as pest management and post-harvest management issues. In this review, different types of biosensors are utilized in the agricultural field for monitoring various parameters related to plants but some obstacles need to be addressed.

In recent years, non-destructive remote sensing techniques have emerged as one of the most promising methods for crop yield monitoring. However, most existing potato yield estimation models have primarily been tested at specific growth stages within a single ecosystem, highlighting the urgent need for a model that can be applied across different ecological environments. In this study, we developed a semi-physical model based on hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to automatically correct yield estimation based on remotely sensed vegetation indices using environmentally relevant variables such as net solar radiation at the surface (ssr), air temperature at 2 m above the surface (t2m), and soil water content in the root zone (swvl). The accuracy and transferability of the model were further evaluated by comparing it with aboveground destructive sampling methods, conventional empirical models, and machine learning approaches. The results demonstrated that site-specific relationships exist between aboveground agronomic traits parameters like biomass and leaf area index (LAI) with respect to yield estimation. Conventional linear statistical and machine learning methods faced challenges in transferring their constructed yield estimation models across regions and years. However, the HLM approach exhibited excellent generalization ability across all trial samples. In the middle and later stages of potato growth, the standardized LAI determining index proved to be the most effective vegetation for predicting yield, while ssr, skt<inf>max</inf>, and shallow swvl were identified as key environmental variables affecting yield. By integrating these variables using HLM modeling techniques, we achieved optimal generalization performance (R2 = 0.57, RMSE = 7.65 t/ha, NRMSE = 25.02 % during tuber growth stage; R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 7.37 t/ha, NRMSE = 24.13 % during starch accumulation stage).

Mangoes are rich in vitamins and minerals. However, its yield is currently severely constrained due to disease and pest infestations. Thus, in order to improve mango fruit quality and productivity, illnesses and insect pests must be detected early on. In this study, we conceived and constructed a mango leaf disease detection mechanism utilizing an ensemble convolutional neural network approach. Healthy and diseased mango leaf images were manually obtained from main producing locations in Amhara Region for Merawi fruit and vegetable research identification. To improve the datasets, several pre-processing procedures (such as image resizing, noise reduction, and image augmentation) were used. To improve classification performance and meet the study's purpose, various segmentation approaches such as k means and Mask R-CNN were applied. Furthermore, following pre-processing and segmentation, features of mango leaf images were retrieved using CNN to obtain important features. The classification model was then constructed using fully-connected layer classifiers on the retrieved features of mango leaf images. The ensemble proposed GoogLeNet and VGG16 based CNN model in the study encompasses various operations, including dataset collection, image preprocessing, noise removal, segmentation, data augmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Upon testing, the model demonstrated impressive performance with 99.87 % training classification accuracy, 99.72 % validation accuracy, and 99.21 % testing accuracy.

The realm of contemporary agriculture is consistently growing with evolving farming techniques and agricultural innovations. Farmers face challenges in keeping pace with the evolving demands of the planet and meeting the requirements of profitable initiatives, characters, and various other stakeholders. Climate change brought on by industry emissions and soil erosion, soil's nutrient deficiency due to mineral's absence, which results in reduced crop growth, and the cultivation of the same crops repeatedly without trying out new varieties are a few of the difficulties farmers face. Without considering the lower quality or quantity, they arbitrarily infuse fertilizers. Using two separate metrics, entropy and Gini indexes, the study analyzes well-known procedures with K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) classifier practices.

Here, we investigated the host range of the tomato pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis (Cm). We determined the genome sequences of 40 tomato Cm isolates and screened them for pathogenicity on tomato and eggplant. Our screen revealed that out of the tested isolates, five were unable to cause disease on any of the hosts, 33 were exclusively pathogenic on tomato, and two were capable of infecting both tomato and eggplant. Through comparative genomic analyses, we identified that the five non-pathogenic isolates lacked the chp/tomA pathogenicity island, which has previously been associated with virulence in tomato. In addition, we found that the two eggplant-pathogenic isolates encode a unique allelic variant of the putative serine hydrolase chpG (chpGC), an effector that is recognized in eggplant. Introduction of chpGC into a chpG inactivation mutant in the eggplant-non-pathogenic strain Cm101, failed to complement the mutant, which retained its ability to cause disease in eggplant and failed to elicit hypersensitive response (HR). Conversely, introduction of the chpG variant from Cm101 into an eggplant pathogenic Cm isolate (C48), eliminated its pathogenicity on eggplant, and enabled C48 to elicit HR. Our study demonstrates that allelic variation in the chpG effector gene is a key determinant of host range plasticity within Cm populations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Protein; Bacterial Proteins; Bradford Protein Assay Kit; Illumina Nextseq2000; Sapphire Biomolecular Imager; Sonic 150w Ultrasonic Processor; 2 Chloro 5 Hydroxyphenylglycine; Genomic Dna; Protein; Bacterial Protein; Agrobacterium Tumefaciens; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Aubergine; Bacterial Strain; Bacterium Culture; Bacterium Transformation; Chromosome; Clavibacter Michiganensis; Disease Severity Assessment; Dna Extraction; Dna Sequence; Electroporation; Escherichia Coli; Gel Electrophoresis; Gene; Gene Expression; Gene Sequence; Genetic Variability; Greenhouse; Host Range; Infectious Agent; Inoculation; Molecular Dynamics; Mutagenesis; Nicotiana Benthamiana; Nonhuman; Pathogenicity; Phytopathogen; Plant Pathogen Interaction; Plasmid; Population; Protein Expression; Protein Purification; Sanger Sequencing; Temperature; Tomato; Transient Expression; Virulence; Western Blotting; Allele; Clavibacter; Genetic Variation; Genetics; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant Disease; Alleles; Bacterial Proteins; Genetic Variation; Host Specificity; Plant Diseases; Solanum Lycopersicum; Solanum Melongena; Virulence,2 chloro 5 hydroxyphenylglycine; genomic DNA; protein; bacterial protein; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; amino acid sequence; Article; artificial intelligence; aubergine; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; bacterium transformation; chromosome; Clavibacter michiganensis; disease severity assessment; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; electroporation; Escherichia coli; gel electrophoresis; gene; gene expression; gene sequence; genetic variability; greenhouse; host range; infectious agent; inoculation; molecular dynamics; mutagenesis; Nicotiana benthamiana; nonhuman; pathogenicity; phytopathogen; plant pathogen interaction; plasmid; population; protein expression; protein purification; Sanger sequencing; temperature; tomato; transient expression; virulence; Western blotting; allele; Clavibacter; genetic variation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; plant disease; Alleles; Bacterial Proteins; Genetic Variation; Host Specificity; Plant Diseases; Solanum lycopersicum; Solanum melongena; Virulence,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199159022

Plant resistance to Ss pertains to quantitative disease resistance (QDR) controlled by multiple minor genes. Genome-wide identification of genes involved in QDR to Ss is yet to be conducted. In this study, we integrated several assays including genome-wide association study (GWAS), multi-omics co-localization, and machine learning prediction to identify, on a genome-wide scale, genes involved in the oilseed rape QDR to Ss. Employing GWAS and multi-omics co-localization, we identified seven resistance-associated loci (RALs) associated with oilseed rape resistance to Ss. Furthermore, we developed a machine learning algorithm and named it Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis and Machine Learning for Target Gene Prediction (iMAP), which integrates multi-omics data to rapidly predict disease resistance-related genes within a broad chromosomal region. Through iMAP based on the identified RALs, we revealed multiple calcium signaling genes related to the QDR to Ss. Population-level analysis of selective sweeps and haplotypes of variants confirmed the positive selection of the predicted calcium signaling genes during evolution. Overall, this study has developed an algorithm that integrates multi-omics data and machine learning methods, providing a powerful tool for predicting target genes associated with specific traits.

Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are essential growth-limiting nutrients and are the primary building elements for amino acids, nucleic acids, proteins, and chlorophyll. The absence of these nutrients has observable effects on various plant characteristics, such as leaf size, color, and plant height. However, recent technological advances in imaging have given birth to computer vision-based plant phenomics, which holds great promise for plant research and management. The non-destructive, quick, automated assessments made possible by these imaging techniques are transforming the field of plant nutrient stress research and monitoring. This paper presents a hybrid quantum–classical model (HQCM) for identifying multi-nutrient stress and nutrient stress level quantification (NSLQ) for plant stress level identification by analyzing plant leaf images, utilizing the combined capabilities of classical and quantum computing systems. The HQCM model uses groundnut multi-nutrient stress (private), rice plant nutrient stress (public), and plant village (public) datasets for experimentation. The HQCM model exhibited impressive levels of accuracy, achieving rates of 97.79%, 97.37%, and 98.75% on the groundnut, rice, and plant village datasets, respectively. This performance surpasses conventional models, including Xception, DECM, DWC, and ResNet50V2.

Here, a phenotyping platform for rapid, continuous-time, and quantitative assessment of HR is demonstrated: Parallel Automated Spectroscopy Tool for Electrolyte Leakage (PASTEL). Compared to traditional HR assays, PASTEL significantly improves temporal resolution and has high sensitivity, facilitating detection of microscopic levels of cell death. Validation is performed by transiently expressing the effector protein AVRblb2 in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana (expressing the corresponding resistance protein Rpi-blb2) to reliably induce HR. Detection of cell death is achieved at microscopic intensities, where leaf tissue appears healthy to the naked eye one week after infiltration.

The species was extensively used to reclaim wastelands. P.Juliflora is known for its ability to reduce soil erosion by stabilizing and binding soils, it acts as an effective windbreaker, and provides ecosystem services viz., nectar, fodder, fruit, and shelter for the faunal habitants. But being exotic, the species is continuously invading landscapes in the arid and semi-arid zone of India and across the globe, causing a negative impact on the ecosystem functions, soil moisture, micronutrients and ecosystem services. Being phreatophyte in nature, this invasive species draws water from the phreatic zones. This species is listed amongst the top 100 least wanted species by IUCN. The rampant and unabated growth of P.Juliflora is reducing the crop yield and abstracting larger quantities of phreatic water in the system. This necessitates accurate mapping of P.Juliflora and its extent of spread using geospatial technologies. In the current study, we use Sentinel 2 data obtained for the year 2022 and machine learning to identify the spatial distribution of P.Juliflora in Hasanparthy village and surrounding areas. The overall accuracy of the land use classification was over 90%, whereas mapping of P.Juliflora was found to have an accuracy of 68%. The study shows P.Juliflora is burgeoning across the study area. Within the study area, P.Juliflora in the study extent cover an area of 607 hectares encompassing 11.9% of study area. Upon maturing the energy potential of existing biomass P.Juliflora is about 374220 GJ.

Fruit classification once required manual sorting, it takes time and requires ongoing human presence. In the past, approaches for classifying fruits using machine learning have been planned. Deep learning may also be a powerful engine for generating the detection and classification of today's reality. The goal is to build a quick and good fruit noticing system that can be a important component of various agricultural robotic platforms and is essential for automatic fruit harvesting and fruit yield prediction. It makes advantage of the completely various fruit and vegetable kinds found in the fruits 360 dataset. Here, we often use three fruits that are separated into three categories: reasonable, Shattered, bare, and raw. Automation is required in the food processing industry since manual techniques are ineffective in producing consistent outcomes. Classification and grading of fruit are steps in the pre-production process. While taste, sweetness, flavor, smell, nutrients, and carbs are internal quality variables exterior qualities include texture, form, colour, size, and volume. By utilizing this technique, accurate fruit sorting and grading might be accomplished in a quick, efficient, and cost-effective manner. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196156807

The assessment of plant growth and composition is vital for determining crop yield and overall quality; however, classical laboratory analyses are slow and costly. Therefore, new, less expensive, more rapid, and non-destructive approaches are being developed, including those based on (hyper)spectral reflectance. Additionally, it is important to determine how plant phenotypes respond to fertilizer treatments and whether these differences in response can be detected from analyses of hyperspectral image data. In the current study, we demonstrate the suitability of hyperspectral imaging in combination with machine learning models to estimate the content of chlorophyll (SPAD), anthocyanins (ACI), glucose, fructose, sucrose, vitamin C, β-carotene, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), dry matter content, and plant fresh weight. Five classification and regression machine learning models were implemented, showing high accuracy in classifying the lettuces based on the applied fertilizers treatments and estimating nutrient concentrations. To reduce the input (predictor data, i.e., hyperspectral data) dimension, 13 principal components were identified and applied in the models. The implemented artificial neural network models of the machine learning algorithm demonstrated high accuracy (r = 0.85 to 0.99) in estimating fresh leaf weight, and the contents of chlorophyll, anthocyanins, N, P, K, and β-carotene. The four applied classification models of machine learning demonstrated 100% accuracy in classifying the studied baby leaf lettuces by phenotype when specific fertilizer treatments were applied. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Baby Leaf Lettuce; Composition; Fertilizers; Hyperspectral Data; Machine Learning; Nutrients,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197167527

The use of vegetation indices and machine learning for yield prediction is rapid, practical, and accurate and contributes to the development of digital agriculture. Although many studies have been carried out on yield estimation, the number of studies on sugar beet and irrigation applications is limited. To solve this problem, in this study yield prediction of sugar beet under different irrigation treatments was carried out using spectral reflection-based vegetation indices obtained by proximal measurements and developed machine learning models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), k-nearest (kNN), bagging (BAG), support vector regression (SVR), gaussian processes (GP), and CustomNet (CN) predictors were used in yield prediction. The irrigation treatments included I<inf>100</inf> (application of irrigation to increase the available moisture to field capacity by around 45–50% of the water holding capacity at the root depth), I<inf>75</inf> (75% of the water applied in the control group), I<inf>50</inf> (50% of the water applied in the control group), and I<inf>125</inf> (25% of the water applied in the control group). The combinations of vegetation indices were determined using Pearson correlation and principal component analysis. OSAVI, SAVI, and NDVI had the most significant influence on the yield prediction of sugar beet. Among the combinations used, the kNN1 model (including all attributes as input) showed high R2 values of 0.99 for training and 0.64 for testing. In addition, the kNN3 model (including Treatment, NDVI, NWI, and OSAVI as inputs) had R2 values of 0.97 for training and 0.65 for testing, indicating successful outcomes. However, the MLP1 and SVR1 models had lower results with test R2 values of 0.53 and 0.56, respectively. The results demonstrate the successful application of machine learning and vegetation indices for yield prediction.

It is produced and consumed in large quantities. It contributes to 15 % of protein intake and 21 % of total per capita energy intake in the region, underscoring its important role as a primary global food source. Conversely, rice plants are heavily affected by bacterial, fungal and other microbial diseases, resulting in reduced plant health and crop yields and posing a major challenge for rice farmers. Manual diagnosis of these diseases is particularly problematic in regions with a shortage of agricultural experts. Farmers with insufficient experience sometimes incorrectly identify these diseases by hand. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) models offer a promising solution through automatic image recognition systems that can be very helpful in accurately identifying these diseases. This manuscript presents a resource-efficient federated learning IoAT (Internet of Agriculture Things) approach for rice leaf disease classification. This approach incorporates two key strategies, namely federated transfer learning and feature extraction, and evaluates their performance on various metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, AUC, and resource-related parameters such as GPU memory consumption, virtual memory, CPU and GPU process utilization. The dataset used in the study includes 5932 images of rice leaf diseases categorized as bacterial leaf blight, blast, brown spot and tungro. The research investigates the application of federated transfer learning and federated feature extraction techniques to classify rice leaf disease images. It performs a comparative analysis of their performance and resource utilization. EfficientNetB3, with an impressive validation accuracy of 99 %, is identified as the base model for the federated learning (FL) environment. Furthermore, we implement FL using both transfer learning and feature extraction methods and compare their results on a number of performance and resource related parameters. It is shown that the federated feature extraction approach has lower GPU memory and process utilization compared to the federated transfer learning approach and is thus more resource efficient. Extracting features before model training results in a lightweight model, which is especially beneficial for FL, IoAT devices that require efficient execution on edge devices. Therefore, the proposed approach is presented as a lightweight, privacy-friendly and resource-efficient solution for rice leaf disease classification. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Data Privacy; Feature Extraction; Federated Learning; Ioat; Resource Utilization; Transfer Learning; Agriculture; Classification (of Information); Data Privacy; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Extraction; Image Recognition; Learning Systems; Disease Classification; Features Extraction; Federated Learning; Internet Of Agriculture Thing; Leaf Disease; Performance; Resource-efficient; Resources Utilizations; Rice Leaves; Transfer Learning; Feature Extraction; Disease Incidence; Leaf; Machine Learning; Parameterization; Resource Use; Rice; Asia,Agriculture; Classification (of information); Data privacy; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Extraction; Image recognition; Learning systems; Disease classification; Features extraction; Federated learning; Internet of agriculture thing; Leaf disease; Performance; Resource-efficient; Resources utilizations; Rice leaves; Transfer learning; Feature extraction; disease incidence; leaf; machine learning; parameterization; resource use; rice; Asia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192185313

In-field fruit maturity indicators are highly variable and require high spatiotemporal resolution data, which can be obtained from contemporary precision agriculture systems. Such systems exploit various state-of-the-art sensors, increasingly relying on spectrometry and imaging techniques in association with advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, in particular, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. This article presents a critical review of precision agriculture techniques for fruit maturity estimation, with a focus on destructive and non-destructive measurement approaches, and the applications of ML in the domain. A critical analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of different techniques is conducted by surveying recent articles on non-destructive methods to discern trends in performance and applicability. Advanced data-fusion methods for combining information from multiple non-destructive sensors are increasingly being used to develop more accurate representations of fruit maturity for the entire field. This is achieved by incorporating AI algorithms, such as support vector machines, k-nearest neighbour, neural networks, and clustering. Based on an extensive survey of recently published research, the review also identifies the most effective fruit maturity indices, namely: sugar content, acidity and firmness. The review concludes by highlighting the outstanding technical challenges and identifies the most promising areas for future research. Hence, this research has the potential to provide a valuable resource for the growers, allowing them to familiarize themselves with contemporary Smart Agricultural methodologies currently in use. These practices can be gradually incorporated from their perspective, taking into account the availability of non-destructive techniques and the use of efficient fruit maturity indices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Digital Farming; Field Robotics; Fruit Maturity; Sensor Fusion; Unmanned Aircraft System; Artificial Intelligence; Food Quality; Food Storage; Fruit; Precision Agriculture; Profitability; Remotely Operated Vehicle; Robotics; Sensor; Size At Maturity,artificial intelligence; food quality; food storage; fruit; precision agriculture; profitability; remotely operated vehicle; robotics; sensor; size at maturity,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186228031

Remote sensing and machine learning approaches can improve sugarcane yield estimation. Previous attempts have however often suffered from too few training samples due to the fact that field data collection is expensive and time-consuming. Our study demonstrates that unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data can be used to generate field-level yield data using only a limited number of field measurements. Plant height obtained from RGB UAV-images was used to train a model to derive intra-field yield maps based on 41 field sample plots spread over 20 sugarcane fields in the Udon Thani Province, Thailand. The yield maps were subsequently used as reference data to train another model to estimate yield from multi-spectral Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery. The integrated UAV yield and S2 data was found efficient with RMSE of 6.88 t/ha (per 10 m × 10 m pixel), for average yields of about 58 t/ha. The expansion of the sugarcane yield mapping across the entire region of 11,730 km2 was in line with the official statistical yield data and highlighted the high spatial variability of yields, both between and within fields. The presented method is a cost-effective and high-quality yield mapping approach which provides useful information for sustainable sugarcane yield management and decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Data Augmentation; Earth Observation; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-2; Sugarcane; Uav; Upscaling; Yield Estimation; Aerial Survey; Crop Yield; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Sentinel; Sugar Cane; Unmanned Vehicle; Upscaling; Northeastern Region; Thailand; Udon Thani,aerial survey; crop yield; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; sugar cane; unmanned vehicle; upscaling; Northeastern Region; Thailand; Udon Thani,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185524914

However, the prevalence of various diseases can severely affect sugarcane yield and quality, making timely and accurate disease detection imperative. Current methods for sugarcane disease detection predominantly rely on traditional image classification models, which often lack the required precision and efficiency, leading to delayed interventions and compromised crop health. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an efficient and novel comparison of Efficient deep learning models that leverages the strengths of multiple deep learning classifiers, including Alex net, ResNet18, VGG19, and Densenet201, for enhanced sugarcane disease prediction. These diseases include Red Rot, Red Rust, mosaic, and yellow leaf disease. In our approach, individual classifiers are initially employed to classify sugarcane images, followed by the identification and comparison of the best-performing classifiers. In this paper, we have used 1990 sugarcane leaf images for the classification of leaf diseases into normal, red rust, red rot, and bacterial blight. or four class classifications, VGG19 had the greatest accuracy of 98.82%, precision of 96.77%, and sensitivity of 96.33%. The implications of this work are profound, as the proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness. This advancement holds the potential to revolutionize sugarcane disease detection, ultimately contributing to better crop management, improved yields, and enhanced profitability for farmers and stakeholders in the sugarcane industry. The integration of efficient deep learning models in agriculture paves the way for more informed decision-making processes, ultimately safeguarding the livelihoods of those dependent on sugarcane farming. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cnn; Mosaic; Red Rot; Red Rust; Yellow,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85205524645

Pathogens manipulate PD-localized proteins to enable intercellular trafficking by removing callose at PD or, conversely, by increasing callose accumulation at PD to limit intercellular trafficking during infection. Plant defense hormones like salicylic acid regulate PD-localized proteins to control PD and intercellular trafficking during immune defense responses such as systemic acquired resistance. Measuring callose deposition at PD in plants has therefore emerged as a popular parameter for assessing likely intercellular trafficking activity during plant immunity. Despite the popularity of this metric, there is no standard for how these measurements should be made. In this study, three commonly used methods for identifying and quantifying plasmodesmal callose by aniline blue staining were evaluated to determine the most effective in the Nicotiana benthamiana leaf model. The results reveal that the most reliable method used aniline blue staining and fluorescence microscopy to measure callose deposition in fixed tissue.

Different management strategies have been established to enhance SOM in arable soils, and one is the application of exogenous organic matter (EOM). Despite significant efforts in recent years, the consequences of EOM addition on increasing soil organic C (SOC) storage and stability in different pedoclimatic contexts remain incompletely understood. In this study, we evaluated the effect of long-term (28 y) sewage sludge (SS) addition to a calcareous soil supporting rainfed extensive crops in a Mediterranean sub-humid area in terms of SOC stabilization and distribution among functional fractions. To that end, we studied total SOM storage and soil fractions in a long-term experiment comparing 4 different doses of SS with mineral fertilization and no-fertilization controls. We compared the concentration, storage and distribution of C using two different fractionation methods (particulate vs. mineral-associated, defined by granulodensimetric fractionation, and active C vs. stable C defined by Rock-Eval® thermal analysis coupled to the machine learning PARTYsoc v2.0 model) on the tilled layer (0–30 cm). Three soil functioning indicators (crops yield, soil microbial biomass C and aggregate stability) were also quantified. We found that SS application, which slightly increased SOC concentration when SS was added, resulted in a net SOC stock gain only with the highest dose used (80 tons/ha), compared to mineral fertilization, suggesting that most of the C added was mineralized. An uneven response of soil fractions was however detected. The coarsest heavy physical fractions > 250 μm and 50–250 μm in size were the most enriched in their C concentration with SS addition, whereas SOC was mostly accumulated as mineral-associated C in the silt-size (2–50 μm) and the 50–250 μm fractions. Regarding thermal fractionation, SS treatments showed C gains between 57 % and 35 % in the active C pool, compared to mineral fertilization. This can be explained considering that the accumulated SOM in mineral-associated fractions corresponded to mean-residence times in the order of 20–40 years. The consequences on soil functioning indicators were not directly related to the amount of SOC stored in the soil, as the highest SOC gains corresponded to the highest dose, but not the highest yields, and some negative correlations were observed between SOC fractions and soil structural stability and microbial biomass. This can be related to some deleterious effects of excessive SS application reducing yields, the soil biological activity and soil structure, and represents an example of the need to decouple the assessment of soil health from that of SOC storage for certain soil management practices. The overall evaluation of the net consequences of long-term SS application indicated that low doses (10 tons/ha) seem a better choice, as they resulted in the highest efficiency in C incorporation, and in a slightly greater increase in SOC concentration than intermediate doses, and equal yields than mineral fertilization, but did not have the negative effects observed in soil functioning with higher doses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Calcareous Soils; Organic Matter Fractionation; Rock-eval®; Sewage Sludge; Soil Organic C; Biogeochemistry; Crops; Decay (organic); Minerals; Particle Size Analysis; Residence Time Distribution; Soils; Stabilization; Thermoanalysis; Calcareous Soils; High Dose; Mineral Fertilization; Organic Matter Fractionation; Rock-eval; Rock-eval®; Sludge Addition; Soil Fractions; Soil Organic C; Soil Organic Matters; Sewage Sludge; Biomass; Calcareous Soil; Sewage; Sludge; Soil Carbon; Soil Organic Matter; Soil Stabilization; Soil Structure,Biogeochemistry; Crops; Decay (organic); Minerals; Particle size analysis; Residence time distribution; Soils; Stabilization; Thermoanalysis; Calcareous soils; High dose; Mineral fertilization; Organic matter fractionation; Rock-Eval; Rock-eval®; Sludge addition; Soil fractions; Soil organic C; Soil organic matters; Sewage sludge; biomass; calcareous soil; sewage; sludge; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil stabilization; soil structure,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189859471

Within this context, soybean pod counting plays an essential role in understanding and optimizing production. Despite recent advancements, the development of a robust pod-counting algorithm capable of performing effectively in real-field conditions remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a pioneering work of accurate soybean pod counting utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured from actual soybean fields in Michigan, USA. Specifically, this paper presents SoybeanNet, a novel point-based counting network that harnesses powerful transformer backbones for simultaneous soybean pod counting and localization with high accuracy. In addition, a new dataset of UAV-acquired images for soybean pod counting was created and open-sourced, consisting of 113 drone images with more than 260k manually annotated soybean pods. The images are taken from an altitude of approximately 13 ft, with angles between 53 and 58 degrees, under natural lighting conditions. Through comprehensive evaluations, SoybeanNet demonstrates superior performance over five state-of-the-art approaches when tested on the collected images.

These methods are time-consuming and may represent limited samples. Therefore, remote sensing technology has become an important tool in disease detection and monitoring in agriculture. In the research, Cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora beticola sacc.) disease, which cause significant economic losses in sugar beet production, were detected in the early stages using machine learning algorithms using non-invasive multispectral images taken with UAV under field conditions is intended to be determined. The research was fulfilled using images from the grower fields in two regions where the disease was observed intensively. Index value data from digital surface model maps created by processing the images taken were used as training and test data. Numerical data was tested using five different supervised machine learning methods. The success of the analyzed models in predicting disease formation from the index values obtained from the images taken and the physiological changes that occur before the disease agents appear on sugar beet leaves was over 70%. Among the models compared in the study, the k-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN) model gave the highest success in both diseases, with 83% accuracy and 76% and 86% f1-score values. The support vector machines model followed the KNN model with 77% accuracy, 75%, and 86% f1-score values. According to the results of the research, it has been revealed that plant diseases have the potential for pre-symptomatic detection, and by processing the images obtained with UAV-based MS images, it is possible to detect diseases in the early period. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190672422

However, current methods involve labor-intensive data collection. Thus, unsupervised anomaly detection in time series imagery was proposed, requiring high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and sophisticated algorithms to identify unknown anomalies amidst complex data patterns to cope with within season crop monitoring and background challenges. The dataset used in this study was acquired by a Micasense Altum sensor on a DJI Matrice 210 UAV with a 4 mm resolution in Gottingen, Germany. The proposed methodology includes (1) date selection for finding the date sensitive to sugar beet changes, (2) vegetation index (VI) selection for finding the one sensitive to sugar beet and its temporal patterns by visual inspection, (3) sugar beet extraction using thresholding and morphological operator, and (4) an ensemble of bottom-up, Kernel, and quadratic discriminate analysis methods for unsupervised time series anomaly detection. The study highlighted the importance of the wide-dynamic-range VI and morphological filtering with time series trimming for accurate disease detection while reducing background errors, achieving a kappa of 76.57%, comparable to deep learning model accuracies, indicating the potential of this approach.

To address the aforementioned issue, this article introduces a deep learning algorithm designed for the segmentation and recognition of agricultural disease images, particularly those involving leaf lesions. The essence of this algorithm lies in enhancing the Multi-scale Attention Net (MA-Net) encoder and attention mechanism to improve the model’s performance when processing agricultural disease images. Firstly, an analysis was conducted on MA-Net, and its limitations were identified. Compared to res-block, Mix Vision Transformer (MiT) consumes relatively less time during the training process, can better capture global and contextual information in images, and has better robustness and scalability. Then, the feature extraction parts of different networks were used as encoders to join the MA-Net network. Compared to a Position-wise Attention Block (PAB), which has higher computational complexity and requires a larger amount of computing resources, Effective Channel Attention net (ECANet) reduces the number of model parameters and computation by learning the correlation between channels, as well as having a better denoising ability. The experimental results show that the proposed solution has high accuracy and stability in agricultural disease image segmentation and recognition. The mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) is 98.1%, which is 0.2% higher than traditional MA-Net; Dice Loss is 0.9%, which is 0.1% lower than traditional MA-Net. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accurate Management; Agriculture; Attention; Computer Vision; Deep Learning; Feature Extraction; Leaf Lesions Segmentation,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192449152

Disease susceptibility during this period can have a profound impact on yields, posing challenges for farmers. Environmental conditions are pivotal in disease occurrence. Unfavorable conditions reduce the likelihood of pathogens infecting vulnerable host plants as temperature and humidity influence pathogen behavior, including toxin synthesis, virulence protein production, and reproduction. Pathogens can lie dormant in the soil until suitable conditions activate them. When the right environment and host plants align, these dormant pathogens can cause outbreaks. Disease prediction becomes possible by analyzing environmental variables. Real-time data collected via strategically placed sensors focused on viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. Results indicated that the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, with a maximum tree depth of 4 and 30 trees per iteration, achieved remarkable performance, yielding an accuracy of 97%. For comparison, the XGBoost model outperformed an 8-layer Backpropagation network with 7 nodes per layer, which achieved 95% accuracy.

Monitoring leaf N content is useful for assessing vine N status and thereby improving N management plans, and the ability to assess N by remote sensing is desirable. Remote sensing technology has been utilized for retrieving N in agronomic crops since the 1990s. However, remote sensing has not been widely adopted for N management mainly due to variability in spectral patterns that emerge when training a model on one dataset and then applying it to a different dataset. Differences in environmental conditions, phenological stages, and plant varieties contribute to variability. This study aimed to understand the major factors limiting the generalizability of N-level retrieval algorithms in grapevine: the impact of leaf age and how calibrating nitrogen content, using either leaf dry mass (N<inf>mass</inf>) or leaf area (N<inf>area</inf>), influence the outcomes. This study also compares the performance among five major N retrieval approaches. We used spectral data from a hand-held hyperspectral sensor measuring wavelengths from 350 to 2500 nm from 664 individual leaf samples obtained from two grapevine varieties on three different sampling campaigns. Our findings indicate that while machine learning and chemometric approaches offer high accuracy levels (R2 = 0.78), the physical modeling approach utilizing the PROSPECT radiative transfer model (RTM) is capable of consistently retrieving N independent of specific dataset conditions and with an acceptable level of accuracy (R2 = 0.45) while using only 50% of the hyperspectral data. The estimation of N<inf>mass</inf> using Protein<inf>mass</inf>, which was calculated from Protein<inf>area</inf> retrieved by RTM and ground truth LMA, demonstrates a high potential for consistent retrieval of Total N (TN) in grapes. We also found that while calibrating a model by N<inf>area</inf> can eliminate the negative impact of leaf age on prediction accuracy, N<inf>mass</inf> still performed better in four out of five approaches tested. This study shows that a hybrid model that combines machine learning and RTM can alleviate the impact of leaf age on prediction accuracy while reducing 50% of spectral bands required and maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy (R2 = 0.54). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Grapevine; Leaf-level Nitrogen; Proximity Sensing; Radiative Transfer Modeling; Machine Learning; Plants (botany); Radiative Transfer; Remote Sensing; Grapevine; Hyperspectral Sensing; Leaf Age; Leaf Level; Leaf-level Nitrogen; Prediction Accuracy; Proximity Sensing; Radiative Transfer Modelling; Remote-sensing; Vitis Vinifera; Nitrogen; Accuracy Assessment; Algorithm; Crop Yield; Environmental Quality; Food Quality; Nutrient Limitation; Radiative Transfer; Remote Sensing; Sampling; Satellite Data; Soil Nitrogen; Vine,Machine learning; Plants (botany); Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Grapevine; Hyperspectral sensing; Leaf age; Leaf level; Leaf-level nitrogen; Prediction accuracy; Proximity sensing; Radiative transfer modelling; Remote-sensing; Vitis vinifera; Nitrogen; accuracy assessment; algorithm; crop yield; environmental quality; food quality; nutrient limitation; radiative transfer; remote sensing; sampling; satellite data; soil nitrogen; vine,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181776500

To limit the harm incurred by those events, farmers resort to plant protection products. Such products are known to have adverse effects both on the environment and on human health. Agronomists make continuous efforts to limit the usage of plant protection products to situations where those products are strictly necessary. To determine such situations, agronomists and policy-makers often rely on decision support tools to model and predict the dynamics of plant diseases. Decision support tools are based either on mechanistic models or on statistical approaches learned from large datasets of biotic (e.g., disease incidence, plant phenological stage) and abiotic (meteorological, soil characteristics) observations in cultures. The surge of powerful machine learning (ML) methods in the last decade makes such approaches a natural pathway to model the dynamics of plant diseases. Machine learning models can reveal the factors that contribute the most to disease and pests outbreaks, provided that those models are simple enough for human inspection. Simplicity, however, may come at the price of lower prediction performances when compared to more complex models. In this paper, we offer a deep look at the performance of ML models of different complexity when used on two use cases of crop disease prediction: downy mildew in the grapevine, and Cercospora leaf spot in the sugar beet. We compare model accuracy and complexity using a year-based cross-validation approach. Our results suggest that interannual meteorological variations are a very important factor in plant disease prediction. Moreover, in line with the observations of the research community in interpretable ML, model complexity stands in clear trade-off with accuracy. This makes models of intermediate complexity appealing for predicting the dynamics of crop diseases as they can provide explicit insights about the rationale of their predictions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180599055

Corn production is highly dependent on the health of the corn plant. Infected plants will decrease corn plant productivity. Usually, corn farmers use conventional methods to control diseases in corn plants. Still, these methods are not effective and efficient because they require a long time and a lot of human labor. Deep learning-based plant disease detection has recently been used for early disease detection in agriculture. In this work, we used convolutional neural network algorithms, namely YOLO-v5 and YOLO-v8, to detect infected corn leaves in the public data set called ‘Corn Leaf Infection Data set’ from the Kaggle repository. We compared the mean average precision (mAP) of mAP 50 and mAP 50-95 between YOLO-v5 and YOLO-v8. YOLO-v8 showed better accuracy at an mAP 50 of 0.965 and an mAP 50-95 of 0.727. YOLO-v8 also showed a higher detection number of 12 detections than YOLO-v5 at 11 detections. Both YOLO algorithms required about 2.49 to 3.75 hours to detect the infected corn leaves.

However, the growth and health of banana plants are heavily reliant on the mineral composition in which they are cultivated. This study presents a comprehensive framework for diagnosing and mitigating of banana plants diseases through an analysis of soil mineral deficiencies. The primary objective regarding to the research is to establish a framework for effective disease management in banana plants by considering the role of soil mineral deficiencies. Specifically, our goal is to: Investigate and understand the relationship between soil mineral deficiencies and the phenomenon of diseases in banana plants. Identify common banana plant diseases associated with specific mineral deficiencies. Develop predictive models and algorithms that make work of machine learning techniques to forecast disease risks based on soil mineral content. Suggest practical recommendations for mitigating disease risks through soil management and targeted fertilization strategies. The background for this proposal stems from a growing concern in the agricultural community about the devastating impact of diseases on banana plantations. Historically, disease management in banana plants has been approached mostly through pest control and environmental interventions. However, as evidence linking mineral deficiencies in the soil to disease occurrence became apparent, it highlighted the need for a more holistic and proactive approach to disease management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Sustainability; Banana Plant; Disease Resistance; Disease Susceptibility; Soil Analysis; Soil Mineral Deficiencies,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185967445

Recently, CYVCV was detected in a localized urban area in a town in the middle of California’s citrus-growing region and marks the first occurrence of the virus in North America. CYVCV has been reported to be spread by aphid and whitefly vectors and is graft and mechanically transmitted. Hence, it is an invasive pathogen that presents a significant threat to the California citrus industry, especially lemons, which are highly symptomatic to CYVCV. To elucidate the origin of the CYVCV California strain, we used long-read sequencing technology and obtained the complete genomes of three California CYVCV isolates, CA1, CA2, and CA3. The sequences of these isolates exhibited intergenomic similarities ranging from 95.4% to 97.4% to 54 publicly available CYVCV genome sequences, which indicated a relatively low level of heterogeneity. However, CYVCV CA isolates formed a distinct clade from the other isolates when aligned against other CYVCV genomes and coat protein gene sequences as shown by the neighbor network analysis. Based on the rooted Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic trees, CYVCV CA isolates shared the most recent common ancestor with isolates from India/South Asia. Bayesian evolutionary inferences resulted in a spatiotemporal reconstruction, suggesting that the CYVCV CA lineage diverged from the Indian lineage possibly around 1995. This analysis placed the origin of all CYVCV to around 1990, with South Asia and/or Middle East as the most plausible geographic source, which matches to the first discovery of CYVCV in Pakistan in 1988. Moreover, the spatiotemporal phylogenetic analysis indicated an additional virus diffusion pathway: one from South Asia to China and South Korea. Collectively, our phylogenetic inferences offer insights into the probable dynamics of global CYVCV dissemination, emphasizing the need for citrus industries and regulatory agencies to closely monitor citrus commodities crossing state and international borders. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bayesian Evolutionary Inference; Citrus Yellow Vein Clearing Virus California Isolate; Genome Sequencing; Spatiotemporal Phylogenetic Analysis; Virus Evolution; Article; Bayesian Evolutionary Inference; California; Citrus Yellow Vein Clearing Virus; Duplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Gene Sequence; Genotype; Genotyping; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Diversity; Phylogenetic Tree; Phylogeny; Plant Virus; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna Extraction; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Viral Evolution; Whole Genome Sequencing; Bayes Theorem; Citrus; Genetics; Plant Disease; Tymovirales; Bayes Theorem; Flexiviridae; Genotype; Phylogeny; Plant Diseases,Article; bayesian evolutionary inference; California; citrus yellow vein clearing virus; duplex polymerase chain reaction; gene sequence; genotype; genotyping; machine learning; nonhuman; nucleotide diversity; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; plant virus; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; spatiotemporal analysis; viral evolution; whole genome sequencing; Bayes theorem; Citrus; genetics; plant disease; Tymovirales; Bayes Theorem; Flexiviridae; Genotype; Phylogeny; Plant Diseases,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186269084

This provides a rich data base for the application of deep learning in biological sequence classification. For predicting and analyzing the biological functions of DNA, RNA, proteins and peptides, sequence-based prediction and analysis play a crucial role. Especially in the field of RNA, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an indispensable role in regulating biological activities, and thus their identification and prediction are important for a deeper understanding of biological processes. In order to achieve more accurate predictions, an improved deep learning model is proposed in this study. The model treats plant lncRNA sequences as natural text, utilizes the BERT model for pre-training, and combines with convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and prediction. The experimental results show that the CNN model trained by BERT exhibits higher accuracy and stability in lncRNA prediction compared with traditional machine learning methods such as SVM, LR, and K-NN.

All these features make it a healthy addition to a balanced diet. Apples come in a large range of colors, flavors, and varieties. There are several types of diseases both bacterial and fungal along with other types of nutritional and soil diseases that hamper the production of apple crops. A few common types of fungal diseases include Apple rot, rust, and scab. Timely identification and proper treatment can save apple crops in early stages of disease progression, saving the crop and not digging a hole in the pocket of the farmer. Until last century manual identification methods were more popular but they were very laborious, time-consuming, and the accuracy was not up to the mark. 21st century marks the use of machine learning and deep learning in almost all aspects of human life including early identification of disease in several plants including Apple. In this paper authors analyze and evaluate what are the current trends in detection of fungal diseases of Apple plants. Out of several types of Apple diseases three main types were chosen to conduct this review and those diseases are rust, scab, and rot. The primary aim of this review article is to analyze the use of various machine learning tools like CNN (convolutional neural network), support vector machine, and k nearest neighbor for the detection of fruit and leaf diseases under these three plant disease categories of Apple.

India is the greatest country for crop cultivation, with the largest amount of agricultural land, approximately 179.9 million hectares, according to statistics and surveys. However, recent changes in the environment's climate have resulted in a sharp decline in crop productivity, which has had a significant impact on farmers. In the current world, it is difficult to predict the climate for growing crops because of the dominant mineral, soil, and temperature elements. Discovering what kind of crops are required to grow a given soil has grown to be a significant problem. This paper includes theoretical and integrated machine learning techniques that can help predict crop cultivation with a higher percentage of accuracy and efficiency. These techniques include Simple Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Natural Language Processing associated with Artificial Intelligence. In addition to improving agricultural productivity, this machine learning technology aids farmers in estimating production costs. By only forecasting the crops that can be grown in the ideal conditions, it makes farming easier.

Methods: The model adopts the encoder-decoder structure of UNet, utilizing MaxViT (Multi-Axis Vision Transformer) as the encoder to capture both global and local features within images. Additionally, CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) is incorporated into the decoder as a multi-scale feature fusion module, adaptively adjusting feature map weights to enable the model to focus more accurately on the edges and textures of crops and weeds. Results and discussion: Experimental results show that the proposed model achieved 84.28% mIoU and 88.59% mPA on the sugar beet dataset, representing improvements of 3.08% and 3.15% over the baseline UNet model, respectively, and outperforming mainstream models such as FCN, PSPNet, SegFormer, DeepLabv3+, and HRNet. Moreover, the model’s inference time is only 0.0559 seconds, reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Its performance on a sunflower dataset further verifies the model’s generalizability and robustness. This study, therefore, provides an efficient and accurate solution for crop-weed segmentation, laying a foundation for future research on automated crop and weed identification. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attention Mechanism; Cbam; Deep Learning; Image Processing; Maxvit; Multi-scale Features; Semantic Segmentation; Unet,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216264432

These diseases bring about fungi, bacteria, and viruses in grape yields, thus diminishing yields and fruit quality while affecting plant health. Thus, detection of these diseases in their early stages and accurately is considered significant to ensure grapevine health for the management of high-quality grapes. The paper presents a proposal for a new EfficientNet-based approach for the classification of grape diseases. This was one of the state-of-The-Art models in convolutional neural networks, with extraordinary effectiveness and efficiency. In this study, grape diseases have been classified into four different categories: black rot, ESCA, leaf blight, and healthy. This dataset contains 1,806 images, each belonging to one of the aforementioned categories. The EfficientNet model does quite well in this classification task, producing an overall accuracy of 99%. Now, at a fine-grained level of analysis, one could expound on the fact that results turn out to achieve very high precision, recall, and f1-scores across all categories; actually, Healthy and Leaf Blight both show perfect scores. Black Rot and ESCA metrics are very impressive, with more than 95% accuracy and recall rate. This clearly emphasizes the model's robustness and effectiveness for differentiating among grape diseases and can be a valuable tool in vineyard management and prevention. This paper shows how state-of-The-Art machine learning techniques can exploit current agricultural practices to really improve grape production outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Imaging; Disease Detection; Efficientnet; Fungal Pathogens; Grape Disease Classification; Machine Learning; Diseases; Agricultural Imaging; Black Rot; Disease Classification; Disease Detection; Efficientnet; Fungal Pathogen; Grape Disease Classification; Leaf Blights; Machine-learning; State Of The Art; Fruits,Diseases; Agricultural imaging; Black rot; Disease classification; Disease detection; Efficientnet; Fungal pathogen; Grape disease classification; Leaf blights; Machine-learning; State of the art; Fruits,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216222798

Therefore, it does not get the as much as attention it requires. Soil pollution emerging as an important threat to soil function for which specific accelerated actions are needed, to maintain nutrient balance, offset the effects of soil pollution, salinization, and soil erosion, and sustains overall soil quality. The physical, chemical, and mineralogical composition of soil is greatly influenced by the processes like weathering, erosion, transportation, and deposition. Thus, an understanding of the processes that controls the behavior of the source material is essential for qualitative as well as quantitative characterization of soil. The sustainable management of soil is directly or indirectly crucial for mineral resource management, nutrient balance, crop production, environmental sustainability, and on human health. Thus, soil heath status study not only will provide an early indication of the problems associated with soil nutrient surplus or a deficit but also it helps in crop yields management. This chapter provides a depth knowledge about the relation between the soil health and nutrient flow by identifying the root cause from the system, i.e., at the field level, farm level, and regional level. This process is done with the help of traditional knowledge and high-resolution data like multispectral data, hyperspectral data, and geographic information system (GIS) approach for spatial variability-based methods proposed in this study. This chapter’s main focus is to manage the spatial variability of soils and nutrients availability by using the techniques like machine learning (ML) and the internet of things (IoT). Digital information extraction method can be broadly used in agricultural field to help farmers to increase productivity, pest management and land sustainability practices. Agriculture can be integrated into urban and peri-urban areas which can contribute to the self-sufficient neighborhood while, reconnecting people with nature and consumption with production.

They're also crucial for keeping our digestive system in good shape. Due to the broad use of onions in areas like health, farming, and our daily routine, it's critical to pinpoint and deal with diseases that affect them. Farmers often struggle to identify leaf diseases at an early stage. Consequently, the disease spreads badly in the crop field, and farmers face a loss in the cultivation season. We, therefore, need an automated onion leaf disease detection system that can diagnose diseases effectively. In this study, we developed a deep learning model that includes soft attention and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) features. We enhanced 3,660 images of four classes, including Botrytis Blight (BB), Downy Mildew (DM), Purple Blotch (PB), and Stemphylium Leaf Blight (SLB) using gamma correction and a green fire-blue filter, intending to enhance the disease spots and boost the performance of our models. We also employed several advanced learning methods to compare with our proposed model: VGG16, VGG19, MobailnetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2. However, our proposed model achieved the best accuracy rate of 96.38%. We tried make it the most accurate and least error-prone compared to the other methods. So, it can be concluded that our proposed approach will help farmers and specialists to diagnose leaf diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",And Multi-class Classification; Data Augmentation; Deep Learning; Image Processing; Onion Leaf Diseases; Diagnosis; And Multi-class Classification; Data Augmentation; Deep Learning; Disease Classification; Images Processing; Leaf Disease; Learning Approach; Multi-class Classification; Onion Leaf Disease; Vitamin C; Vegetables,Diagnosis; And multi-class classification; Data augmentation; Deep learning; Disease classification; Images processing; Leaf disease; Learning approach; Multi-class classification; Onion leaf disease; Vitamin C; Vegetables,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215517247

This chapter explores the complex dynamics of assessing soil fertility in these regions, emphasizing the need for innovative assessment approaches that integrate traditional knowledge, advanced technologies, and data-driven insights. The multifaceted nature of soil fertility, encompassing organic, mineral, physical, and biological aspects, requires a balanced and optimized approach for sustainable agricultural production. Soil fertility decline, though less visible than erosion, poses a significant threat to agricultural productivity and food security. Investigating and mitigating soil fertility loss demand attention, emphasizing the importance of long-term research and monitoring to comprehend slow and seasonal changes in soil properties. Farmers, equipped with valuable knowledge gained through years of observation, play a pivotal role in shaping effective agricultural programs and policies. Integrating farmers’ perceptions into decision-making processes enhances the sustainability and effectiveness of interventions. Oil analysis, especially in regions with low fertility, high pH, and low organic matter, empowers farmers to make informed decisions regarding crop selection, irrigation, and fertilization practices. Innovative tools, including portable spectrophotometers, hyperspectral imaging, and artificial intelligence (AI), offer promising solutions to overcome limitations in conventional nutrient analysis method and to optimize resource allocation and enhancing productivity. Static soil maps are relics of the past. Digital soil mapping (DSM), leveraging environmental data and advanced algorithms, offers a dynamic and highly accurate picture of soil fertility variations, enabling targeted interventions and informed land-use planning. Recommendations for promoting farmer-centric approaches, investing in research and technology adoption, embracing DSM and AI, nurturing traditional knowledge, and prioritizing resource conservation are outlined. Investing in research, technology adoption, and farmer-centric approaches is crucial. We must embrace traditional knowledge, promote DSM and AI, and prioritize resource conservation. By implementing these recommendations, resilient soils in arid and semiarid regions can be cultivated, ensuring long-term health and productivity crucial for global food security.

However, many diseases attack apple plants like “Scab”, “Rust”, and “Black rot”. These diseases are responsible for the decrease in the production and cultivation of apples. Identification of these diseases at an early stage can play an important role in their control before spreading into other parts of the plant. This job is challenging, especially in leaves even through an expert’s eye and many imaging methods are applied to identify these diseases from images using machine learning algorithms. To automate the process in real-time monitoring of Apple farms, this paper presents a framework for detecting diseases in apple leaves using a Wireless Visual Sensor Network (WVSN). A WVSN utilizes Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for cloud-based classification. The framework will periodically capture the images directly from the apple farms through wireless nodes and send the data to the cloud through a gateway for further processing where the trained model classifies the diseases accurately. We tested our proposed model on the developed dataset to benchmark it against other state-of-the-art studies and subsequently deployed it in Apple farms to ensure the best results.

The crop's nutritional composition, rich in carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, makes it a valuable addition to the Indian diet. Maize leaf diseases are a major threat to maize farming, reducing production and quality on a global scale. Maize rust, northern leaf blight, southern leaf blight, and maize stripe virus are some of the most notable diseases. These diseases cause substantial financial losses by reducing yields, increasing production costs due to disease management methods, and compromising grain quality.

Deep learning models require large, realistic datasets, which are often difficult to obtain. Data augmentation, especially through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has become essential in farming applications, generating synthetic images to improve model training and reduce the need for extensive image collection. This review explores various GAN approaches for image augmentation in farming, investigating their challenges and limitations. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 128 publications were analyzed to identify research trends and gaps in GAN applications within the farming industry. Key applications of GANs include plant classification, weed detection, animal detection and behavior recognition, animal health and disease analysis, plant disease detection, phenotyping, and fruit quality assessment. Persistent issues like limited training datasets, occlusion challenges, and imbalanced data hinder model performance across these applications. Recognizing these challenges is critical for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of farming operations.

Soybean (Glycine max), a key contributor to global plant-based protein supplies, requires ongoing yield enhancements to keep pace with increasing demand. Precise, on-plant seed counting and localization may catalyze breeding selection of shoot architectures and seed localization patterns related to superior performance in high planting density and contribute to increased yield. Traditional manual counting and localization methods are labor-intensive and prone to error, necessitating more efficient approaches for yield prediction and seed distribution analysis. To solve this, we propose MSANet: a novel deep learning framework tailored for counting and localization of soybean seeds on mature field-grown soy plants. A multi-scale attention map mechanism was applied to maximize model performance in seed counting and localization in soybean breeding fields. We compared our model with a previous state-of-the-art model using the benchmark dataset and an enlarged dataset, including various soybean genotypes.

India has emerged as the top country to grow potatoes after China, resulting in the maximum population relying on the income through potato production. For millions of individuals, potato is the primary source of nutrition. However. with the sudden changes in the weather conditions, the health of the potato leaves has been badly affected resulting in a decrease in crop production. These leaves are affected by bacteria and fungi, which are required to be tracked to reduce the losses in crop yield. In the proposed work, a convolutional neural network model has been utilized and implemented on the potato leaf disease data collected from Kaggle for predicting the presence of the disease. The categorization of leaf diseases provides an essential foundation for identifying and controlling the complex disease-causing agents impacting potato crops. This paper presents the model's overall performance during training and validation with two different epochs 20 and 30. Accuracy and performance with loss assessments are also used and presented in the work. For epoch 20 during training, accuracy is 97.14% and a loss is 0.0864 has been identified. Similarly, accuracy and loss at epoch 30 are 98.43% and 0.0539, respectively. On the other hand, at epoch 20, the testing accuracy is 96.39%, whereas, the loss is 0.0842. After increasing the epoch count to 30, the testing accuracy of 97.60%, and the loss of 0.1077 have been resulted. These findings show that CNN is capable of correctly classifying potato leaf disease, paving the way for automated disease classification and higher agricultural yield. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Image Processing; Multi-class Classification; Potato Leaf Disease Detection; Deep Neural Networks; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Disease Classification; Images Processing; Leaf Disease; Leaf Disease Detections; Multi-class Classification; Neural Network Model; Performance; Potato Leaf Disease Detection; Convolutional Neural Networks,Deep neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease classification; Images processing; Leaf disease; Leaf disease detections; Multi-class classification; Neural network model; Performance; Potato leaf disease detection; Convolutional neural networks,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207377751

However, pests and disease outbreaks are the major problems for farmers as this rice crop is susceptible to fungi and viruses. Leaf Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, and Leaf Hispa are among the most well-known diseases that affect the rice crop.

CRISPR/Cas systems have emerged as revolutionary tools for precise genetic modifications in crops, offering significant advancements in resilience, yield, and nutritional value, particularly in staple crops like rice and maize. This review highlights the transformative potential of CRISPR/Cas technology, emphasizing recent innovations such as prime and base editing, and the development of novel CRISPR-associated proteins, which have significantly improved the specificity, efficiency, and scope of genome editing in agriculture. These advancements enable targeted genetic modifications that enhance tolerance to abiotic stresses as well as biotic stresses. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas plays a crucial role in improving crop yield and quality by enhancing photosynthetic efficiency, nutrient uptake, and resistance to lodging, while also improving taste, texture, shelf life, and nutritional content through biofortification. Despite challenges such as off-target effects, the need for more efficient delivery methods, and ethical and regulatory concerns, the review underscores the importance of CRISPR/Cas in addressing global food security and sustainability challenges.

Each of these marker’s aids in gaging the existence of specific proteins, thereby enhancing output detection. Currently, these markers are employed to detect diverse outputs, such as those related to different cancer and disease types. The algorithms developed to discern these outputs operate by ranking these biomolecular markers based on their genomic significance. A review of existing research reveals that present models for marker ranking target a single output type, constraining their adaptability and efficacy for real-world clinical use. Additionally, these models suffer from extended training and validation periods, impeding their practical utility. To overcome these limitations, our research introduces an advanced ensemble learning approach to amplify output detection proficiency. We applied our approach to various outputs, including different disease types. Our findings underscore the model’s superior accuracy and speed compared to current top-tier methods.

Plants are often considered life savers for humanity, having evolved complex adaptations to cope with adverse environmental conditions. Protecting agricultural produce from devastating conditions such as stress is essential for the sustainable development of the nation. Plants respond to various environmental stressors such as drought, salinity, heat, cold, etc. Abiotic stress can significantly impact crop yield and development posing a major threat to agriculture. SNARE proteins play a major role in pathological processes as they are vital proteins in the life sciences. These proteins act as key players in stress responses. Feature extraction is essential for visualizing the underlying structure of the SNARE proteins in analyzing the root cause of abiotic stress in plants. To address this issue, we developed a hybrid model to capture the hidden structures of the SNAREs. A feature fusion technique has been devised by combining the potential strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with a high dimensional radial basis function (RBF) network.

The exact tar spot of the sugar maple class fraction is paramount to developing effective control practices. As our task, we suggest a new Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)based framework for increasing the accuracy of severity classification through a convolutional neural network-generative adversarial network architecture. The CNN-GAN infrastructure blends machine intelligence methods to make the process of automation and increase disease classification accuracy. We carried out the multistep process of collecting a comprehensive dataset of sugar maple leaf images representing different levels of degree of tar spot and finally trained the CNN-GAN network using a systematic methodology. Experiments conducted indicate successful implementation of the algorithm based on the CNN-GAN model as the network system has yielded the accuracies of classification of sugar maple tar spot severity being 95.62%.

Nevertheless, farmers face substantial economic risks due to the susceptibility of potatoes to diseases like early blight, late blight, and various leaf-related afflictions. These vulnerabilities pose significant threats to agricultural livelihoods, food security, and community well-being. To tackle the challenges we face, we need to approach them comprehensively, covering both agricultural and social aspects. This issue can be effectively solved by utilizing pre-trained models. These models have already been extensively trained on large datasets and can be tailored to specific tasks. To refine a model, first unfreeze it or a portion of it, and then train it with a low learning rate on new data. Optimizing performance involves fine-tuning the Xception architecture. This goal can be accomplished by changing the parameters, such as the Adam optimizer and fine-tuning learning rate to 1e-4. The four models that will be examined include VGG19, DenseNet121, Xception, and the proposed fine-tuned Xception model. This study uses images of potato leaves from the PlantVillage dataset to evaluate different models. Potato leaf classification into categories like healthy, early blight, or late blight is contingent upon assessing performance metrics such as recall, F1-score, and precision. Drawing from the outcomes of experiments, the proposed fine-tuned Xception model achieves 95.37% accuracy, which is superior to other models.

However, diseases like brown rust, septoria, yellow rust, and other fungus diseases pose notable threats to wheat crops, impacting production and quality. Diagnosing these diseases is challenging, especially in areas with limited agricultural experts. Thus, creating computerized disease identification and decision-support technologies is crucial for safeguarding wheat leaf preservation and crop loss mitigation. The traditional approach to integrating data gathering and model training has substantial challenges in terms of data confidentiality, availability, and the costs related to data transmission. To address these challenges, federated learning (FL) is an appealing and effective option. Our study focuses on applying FL to classify agricultural diseases using image analysis. In our study, we conduct experiments on high-parameterized transfer learning (TL) models along with our proposed architecture based on the attention mechanism, introducing these models into a distributed learning strategy founded in FL. Our proposed architecture leverages the beneficial interactions of two cutting-edge vision transformer models including the advanced depthwise incorporating self-attention model referred to as CoAtNets, and the enhanced Swin Transformer V2, resulting in enhanced feature representation. Moreover, we introduce weight pruning into our model which is further classified by a reinforced linear attention mechanism (LA) to lower output dimensions. Our pruned lightweight (32M parameters) considerably decreases inference time with 624.249 ms and 644.899 on devices with low computational power, making it highly efficient in FL-based systems. The proposed model in our FL system significantly outperforms all other tested transfer learning models, including ConvNeXtBase, ConvNeXtLarge, EfficientNetV2L, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet152, and NASNetLarge, achieving accuracies up to 98% and 99%, precision up to 98%, recall up to 98%, and F-1 scores up to 95% across multiple input dimensions for wheat leaf disease classification. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attention Mechanism; Deep Learning; Federated Learning; Machine Learning; Transformers; Wheat Leaf Disease Identification; Decision Support Systems; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Adaptation Models; Attention Mechanisms; Computational Modelling; Federated Learning; Machine-learning; Transformer; Wheat Leaves; Crops,Decision support systems; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Adaptation models; Attention mechanisms; Computational modelling; Federated learning; Machine-learning; Transformer; Wheat leaves; Crops,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200802907

Recognizing the critical relationship between agricultural productivity and a country's economy, specialists have made significant investments in the early diagnosis of leaf diseases in order to protect the entire plant from degeneration. The abundance of data, improved resource availability, and improvements in learning algorithms are all credited with the recent achievements of Machine Learning (ML) models. In order to improve system efficiency, the traditional method for detecting leaf diseases uses a Model-Centric approach that optimizes hyperparameters. The emphasis has recently switched from model-entered to data-centered techniques, in which the model is kept constant, but dataset quality is increased by addressing issues like label consistency and systematic sampling of training data while choosing the right batches. The current paper comprises using confidence learning to locate and remove noisy labels from the Cassava Leaf Disease Classification dataset. The model is then fed with newly produced high-quality data, and the performance of the model-centric and data-centric approaches are contrasted.

Rising temperatures due to global warming significantly alter plant phenological stages, shortening crucial periods such as reproduction and grain-filling, leading to reduced yields. Through comprehensive modeling studies, the research highlights both regional increases and decreases in crop productivity. While wheat yields might rise in specific regions such as Western Europe and Canada, significant reductions are anticipated in countries such as India and Pakistan. Similar challenges are faced by rice production, particularly in regions such as Central Asia and Europe, with potential global yield decreases of up to 13.1%. These findings underscore the urgent need for adaptation strategies, including crop changes and altered sowing seasons, emphasizing the critical role of precise predictions in mitigating climate change’s impact on global agriculture. Elevated CO2 levels lead to starch accumulation, diluting proteins and minerals in crops such as wheat and rice, while elevated temperatures and drought conditions affect grain constituents and oilseed quality. Additionally, climate change influences antinutrient levels and fosters mycotoxin-producing fungi, posing health risks. As climate change intensifies, innovative plant breeding approaches are crucial to develop resilient crops. Integration of high-throughput phenotyping, molecular markers, machine learning, CRISPR/Cas genome editing, and speed breeding creates a powerful toolkit. These multidisciplinary methods not only accelerate breeding but also ensure precision agriculture, enabling swift adaptation to climate challenges and securing the global food supply. Traditional breeding coupled with advanced genomic tools provides a foundation for creating climate-resilient “smart crops,” bridging the gap between production demands and unpredictable climate changes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Breeding Innovations; Climate Change; Crop; Pests; Quality; Yield,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85199138979

The critical B level in soil is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 ppm, but it varies widely depending on the crops and growing conditions. The prevalent deficiency in agricultural fields, coupled with insufficient attention to micronutrient application in field crops, creates a substantial production gap impacting growth, yield, and produce quality. A major portion of the tuber crops show extreme sensitivity to boron deficiency, which causes severe yield reduction alongside a decline in the tuber quality. Excess application may exhibit toxicity symptoms in plants since it occupies a narrow window between deficiency and toxicity. Therefore, efficient nutrient management practice, including the judicious use of boron fertilizers in terms of appropriate sources and doses, is needed to ensure the B nutrient balance in soil as well as augmenting the crop growth and yield. To understand the research and progress toward B nutrition in tuber crops, a modern machine learning approach has also been implemented. This review underscores a paradigm shift in understanding the essential role of B fertilizers in tuber crops there by suggesting a potentially sustainable solution for achieving judicious and balanced application of boron in acquiring healthy plant produce. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Functions; Impact; Management; Micronutrients; Quality; Tuber Yield,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85198712975

Approximately 50% of the labour force in the nation is employed by it, either directly or indirectly. Fertilizers playa crucial role in modern agriculture by enhancing soil fertility and promoting optimal plant growth. They provide essential nutrients to plants, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. To boost crop yields, commercial fertilizers are sprayed on agricultural crops. The majority of farming took place on tiny family farms with little usage of chemicals before to the 1950s. Since then, the usage of chemical fertilizers in contemporary agricultural methods has paralleled with the move toward larger corporate farms. Farmers may lack knowledge about the various types of fertilizers available, their formulations, and the appropriate selection for specific crops and soil conditions. This can lead to the use of inappropriate or imbalanced fertilizers.

It is the primary source of carbohydrates, especially for subcontinental people. Diseases like Blast, Bacterial Leaf Blight, Tungro, and Brown Spot can significantly decrease the production of rice and degrade the quality of the produced crop. These diseases impose an intolerable threat to the global food chain, availability, and security system which causes serious yield loss. Therefore, the early detection of rice leaf diseases for effective production control management is crucial to minimize loss. This study proposes a novel resource-efficient, low-complexity lightweight model for distinguishing these diseases from healthy data. The proposed pipeline mitigates the data imbalance issue by employing the SMOTE over-sampling technique. The performance of the proposed Light-Weight Dense Model is evaluated by comparing it with benchmark deep learning models including Resnet50, DenseNet201, VGG19, and MobileNet. It surpasses these traditional models significantly with 99.68% accuracy and secures an AUC score of 1.00. In addition, this study thoroughly assesses the performance of the proposed model across various image shapes, consistently demonstrating noteworthy results. Furthermore, stress testing is carried out to evaluate the adaptability and reliability of the proposed model on various datasets. The results emphasize the effectiveness of the model, outperforming other deep learning models with a 100% accuracy rate (AUC = 1.00). The findings demonstrate the development of a generalized pipeline for the early detection of rice leaf diseases using a diverse training dataset of varying data sizes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Deep Neural Network; Image Classification; Light-weight Dense Model; Rice Leaf Disease Detection; Benchmarking; Crops; Deep Neural Networks; Disease Control; Learning Systems; Pipelines; Production Control; Deep Learning; Images Classification; Leaf Disease; Leaf Disease Detections; Learning Models; Light Weight; Light-weight Dense Model; Performance; Rice Leaf Disease Detection; Rice Leaves; Image Classification,Benchmarking; Crops; Deep neural networks; Disease control; Learning systems; Pipelines; Production control; Deep learning; Images classification; Leaf disease; Leaf disease detections; Learning models; Light weight; Light-weight dense model; Performance; Rice leaf disease detection; Rice leaves; Image classification,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197766974

This affects the productivity and economic prospects of cherry orchards worldwide. CLS, a complex beast with far-reaching implications for crops' yield and fruit quality, requires comprehensive treatments. The proposed study novel hybrid model that creatively combines the benefits of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost. This breakthrough offers an entirely new concept for automated plant disease detection research. But fundamentally, this study is based on a dataset built very carefully - there are 7500 high-resolution images from many orchards that were painstakingly collected and contributed. This rich dataset becomes the ground on which our hybrid model paints its masterly portrait of disease-discriminating prowess. This model has an impressive overall accuracy of 98.67%, which represents a breakthrough in plant disease diagnosis by robots.

It helps keep crops healthy and makes farming last longer. Tomato leaf diseases are big problems for farmers and the farming business. Some of the key challenges associated with tomato leaf diseases include: Plant diseases in the leaves of tomato plants directly lead to a decrease in crop production. Diseases like early blight, late blight and bacterial wilt cause leaves to fall off too soon. This results in the plant's ability to grow fruit properly. Diseases in leaves can affect tomatoes by decreasing fruit production with weird shapes and marks. This not only makes the food look bad but can also result in people saying no to buying it and making its worth lower. In the proposed work, we proposed a strong ensemble model that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This helps to accurately identify ten different types of tomato leaf diseases using a learning rate of 0.015, our hybrid model gets an accuracy at 99.8%. The model's performance is shown more by a loss value of 0.032, showing how good it is at finding complicated patterns in the data set. This smart method not only shows the strength of mixing LSTM and CNN designs, but it also helps in improving the classification accuracy of tomato leaf disease detection. It provides a trustworthy tool for farmers and scientists working on growing plants for many kinds of disease detection in tomato plants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Classification; Disease Detection; Hybrid Model; Image Processing; Tomato Leaf; Classification (of Information); Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Cultivation; Farms; Image Classification; Long Short-term Memory; Plants (botany); Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Detection; Human Bodies; Hybrid Model; Images Processing; Leaf Disease; Multi-class Classification; Neural Network Model; Tomato Leaf; Tomato Plants; Fruits,Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Cultivation; Farms; Image classification; Long short-term memory; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Human bodies; Hybrid model; Images processing; Leaf disease; Multi-class classification; Neural network model; Tomato leaf; Tomato plants; Fruits,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196833230

The motivation behind this study comes from how to increase the wheat crop growth and prevent wheat diseases as this plant plays a significant impact on food security all over the world. Wheat plant diseases can be divided into fungal, bacterial, viral, nematode, insect pests, physiological and genetic anomalies, and mineral and environmental stress. Digital images containing the wheat plant disease are collected from different public sources like Kaggle and GitHub.

The objective of this study was to differentiate between resistant and susceptible genotypes by morphological characteristics using image analysis based on the damage caused by the gall wasp. In addition, consensus sequences derived from transposable elements (TEs) and the genome of Eucalyptus spp. Were identified by in silico analysis. Furthermore, another objective was to discriminate Eucalyptus genotypes in response to Leptocybe invasa by conducting molecular analyses involving transposable elements and inter simple sequence markers. For image analysis, the GroundEye ® system was used to collect images of 60 leaves from six genotypes, three of which were resistant and three susceptible. Eucalyptus spp. sequences were obtained from the GenBank database by in silico analysis and pairwise alignments with TE sequences were conducted using BLASTN. Multiple sequence alignment was performed with Clustal Omega, followed by the identification of conserved regions in Jalview. A motif signature was generated using Weblogo. For molecular characterization using ISSR markers and TEs, samples of young leaves were obtained from a total of 80 Eucalyptus seedlings, of which 50 were classified as resistant and 30 as susceptible to L. invasa. It was possible to distinguish gall wasp susceptible and resistant genotypes by image analysis. In silico analysis enabled the identification of conserved regions in the Eucalyptus spp. genome, which were associated with proteins involved in secondary metabolite production, e.g., terpenes, which play a role in the response to L. invasa. The discrimination capacity of TEs and ISSR primers was demonstrated and bands were generated that could be used to identify resistant genotypes.

Beans are an economically significant type of crops that not only provide a rich source of protein but also offers substantial health benefits. However, beans are susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections. If left uncontrolled, these diseases could result in severe consequences. Diagnosis of the affected leaves can be done by plant pathologists, which is not readily available in local and remote areas. Using deep learning algorithms, an accurate classification of bean leaf diseases can offset this problem from an early stage. This research introduces a framework for optimizing MobileNetV3 using Particle Swarm Optimization that can accurately identify healthy or diseased bean leaves from images captured in real-world conditions. With having only 2.9M parameters, the best model achieved a high degree of accuracy at 98.44% on unseen data, outperforming the models proposed by other researchers on the same classification task. Results suggest that the model can be adopted in the field to increase the efficiency in the early identification of bean leaf diseases.

To address these challenges, predictive tools that can evaluate crop suitability to varying soil conditions and nutrient compositions are needed; however, the application of data mining and machine learning in agriculture is still relatively new. This study attempts to close this gap by utilizing a variety of regression techniques, such as random forest, linear regression, decision tree regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regression. These methodologies are used to predict crop performance. The study also explores the important topic of plant diseases, which are a major threat to crop quality, productivity, and economic viability. Advanced methods for monitoring pests are explained, including thorough methods for identifying plant pests in important crops including cotton, citrus, and rice.

This primary need is very difficult to replace with other staples, such as corn, tubers, sago and other sources of carbohydrates. However, global climate change which has an impact on climate anomalies causes rice diseases to develop rapidly. The aim of this research is to create an application on an Android-based cell phone that can identify and classify rice plant diseases using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method. The research material was 1600 images of rice leaves consisting of 4 classes, namely 400 images of rice affected by Leaf Blight disease, 400 images of rice affected by Brown Spot disease, 400 images of rice affected by Leaf Smut disease, and 400 images of healthy rice. In each class, the images are divided into 380 for training and 20 for testing. During the rice image training process using the Python programming language, the accuracy results were 83%. Then the results are saved in the form of a model file, and entered as training data into the program in Android Studio to be used as an application. Testing the application with 20 rice leaf images for each class resulted in an actual accuracy of 94%. This application can also be run on all versions of Android. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Android; Climate Change Impact; Convolutional Neural Network (cnn); Image Classification; Rice Disease,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195822706

It is a very hard task for government institutions and farmers to collect data on plant diseases from different distributed lands among regions. Therefore, data collection, disease detection, and processing are the key issues for plants when they are suffering from healthy and unhealthy issues in different lands. This article presents edge-cloud remote sensing data-based plant disease detection by exploiting deep neural networks with transfer learning. The objective is to solve the aforementioned issues, such as data collection at a wide range, disease detection, and processing them with higher accuracy and time on different machines. We suggest transfer learning commutative fuzzy deep convolutional neural network (FCDCNN) schemes based on combinatorial optimization problems. The convex function optimizes the processing time and learning rate of data training on different edge and cloud nodes to collect more and more data from different plants from distributed lands. In the concave function, we predict the diseases among different plants, such as sugarcane, blueberry, cotton, and cherry with images, videos, and numeric values. The plant disease detection app uses edge nodes and remote satellite point cloud nodes to gather and train data using transfer learning and make predictions using fuzzy DCNN schemes that are more accurate and take less time to process. Simulation results show that FCDCNN obtained higher accuracy by 98% with less processing time 25% and trained with a higher ratio of data than existing schemes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Edge Point Cloud; Fuzzy Deep Neural Networks; Plant Disease Detection; Remote Sensing Data; Transfer Learning; Data Acquisition; Deep Neural Networks; Edge Detection; Fuzzy Logic; Fuzzy Neural Networks; Sugar Cane; Disease Detection; Edge Point; Edge Point Cloud; Fuzzy Deep Neural Network; Image Edge Detection; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Detection; Point Cloud Compression; Point-clouds; Remote Sensing Data; Remote-sensing; Transfer Learning; Remote Sensing; Artificial Neural Network; Detection Method; Disease; Fuzzy Mathematics; Machine Learning; Plant; Remote Sensing,Data acquisition; Deep neural networks; Edge detection; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Sugar cane; Disease detection; Edge point; Edge point cloud; Fuzzy deep neural network; Image edge detection; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Point cloud compression; Point-clouds; Remote sensing data; Remote-sensing; Transfer learning; Remote sensing; artificial neural network; detection method; disease; fuzzy mathematics; machine learning; plant; remote sensing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195394043

It can affect crop yield and quality. Identifying and classifying weeds can indeed be challenging for farmers due to their similarities and the potential negative impact they can have on crop growth. Pre-processing, segmentation, extraction of features, and classification are the four processing steps for categorizing crops and weeds. In this work, a BIRCH algorithm is introduced for the segmenting process along with a deep learning model for the classification process. The aim of the work was to categorize weeds and crop species based on various features, including the MBP and GLCM, are extracted from the segmented outcome. Finally, the hybrid model classification system, which is a combination of improved Bi-LSTM and CNN, receives the obtained features as input and classifies whether they are weeds or crops. The hybrid model determines the classification of crops and weeds by averaging the output of two classifiers, which gives 97.33% accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Birch; Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix; Improved Bilstm And Cnn; Median Binary Pattern; Long Short-term Memory; Sugar Beets; Binary Patterns; Birch; Crop Quality; Crop Yield; Field Crops; Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix; Grey-level Co-occurrence Matrixes; Hybrid Model; Improved Bilstm And Cnn; Median Binary Pattern; Crops,Long short-term memory; Sugar beets; Binary patterns; BIRCH; Crop quality; Crop yield; Field crops; Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Grey-level co-occurrence matrixes; Hybrid model; Improved BILSTM and CNN; Median binary pattern; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195372499

Vegetation indices can provide valuable insight into crop health and growth, especially in conventional agriculture and small-sized experimental plots. However, the effectiveness of such methods in non-conventional agricultural systems still needs to be clarified. This study was the first to test three vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE) for grain yield and protein content prediction in organic farming under real-life farm management practices. Using two small-plot and one on-farm organic wheat variety trial sites, unmanned aerial vehicle-based remote sensing data was compared with physical sampling results in 2 years to assess the potential of agricultural remote sensing to predict yield and protein content on small- and medium-sized plots of organic winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The correlations between vegetation indices and crop traits were stronger in small- than in medium-sized plots (r<inf>max</inf> = 0.85 and 0.75, respectively, for grain yield), probably due to increased heterogeneity of the larger plots, due to differences in weed cover, soil nutrient supply, etc., and it was strongly affected by the time of measurement. Linear equation for yield and protein content prediction was not sufficiently precise; the machine learning algorithms improved the accuracy of yield estimation. Both methods considered NDRE with a higher weight than NDVI when modelling grain yield and protein content based on the vegetation index values, which suggested that NDRE was more suitable for prediction. Small-plot-based predictions over-estimated grain yield and under-estimated grain protein content in medium-sized plots. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Yield And Protein Content; Green Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (gndvi); Normalised Difference Red Edge (ndre); Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (ndvi); Triticum Aestivum; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; Algorithm; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Machine Learning; Ndvi; Organic Farming; Remote Sensing; Soil Nutrient; Unmanned Vehicle; Vegetation Index,algorithm; crop production; crop yield; machine learning; NDVI; organic farming; remote sensing; soil nutrient; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195295649

Farmers play a major role in cultivating crops. Oil seed crops are grown primarily for the oil contained in the seeds. Fats in the oil seeds are the major source for vitamins and other essential nutrients. Culinary vegetable oils are versatile ingredients that can be used raw in salads, heated for cooking, or hardened to produce lard or vegetable spread. These oil-based products can replace animal products, such as butter and ghee, which are in inadequate supply to meet the demands of a growing population. The production of oilseed crops requires the application of appropriate manure rates. Yields drop and the environmental load rises when fertilizers are in short supply or are over-applied. In this research the data was gathered from 2019 to 2022, with the training set consisting of actual yield data from 2020 to 2023. This means that the machine learning model is trained on data from the past three years, and then used to make predictions for the future. The proposed system will utilize historical crop data, weather patterns, and soil information to train bootstrap bagging (bootstrap aggregation) algorithm. Leveraging the power of comprehensive datasets, this system predicts crop yields with greater precision, empowering farmers to make accurate decisions on crop management, resource allocation, and marketing strategies. The proposed approach also incorporates disease forecasting for oilseed crops and other plants, enabling farmers to proactively mitigate potential risks and maximize yields. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bootstrap Bagging Algorithm; Comprehensive Datasets; Culinary Vegetable Oils; Disease Forecasting; Historical Crop Data; Machine Learning Model; Resource Allocation; Risk Mitigation; Vegetable Spread; Cultivation; Decision Making; Economics; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Information Management; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Oilseeds; Resource Allocation; Vegetable Oils; Bagging Algorithms; Bootstrap Bagging Algorithm; Comprehensive Dataset; Culinary Vegetable Oil; Disease Forecasting; Historical Crop Data; Machine Learning Models; Resources Allocation; Risk Mitigation; Vegetable Spread; Crops,Cultivation; Decision making; Economics; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Information management; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Oilseeds; Resource allocation; Vegetable oils; Bagging algorithms; Bootstrap bagging algorithm; Comprehensive dataset; Culinary vegetable oil; Disease forecasting; Historical crop data; Machine learning models; Resources allocation; Risk mitigation; Vegetable spread; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195184811

The Department of Agriculture recognized it in 2003. This variety is now grown in Sri Lanka's Dry and Intermediate zones. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can assist agriculture producers in making more informed decisions. The study covers prospective mango farming applications of the TJC Mango Dataset (MangoDB) contributed by AI, including yield prediction, disease detection, and fruit quality evaluation. MangoDB is a unique post-harvest TJC Mango fruit image collection. Five TJC mango label classifications have 200 photographs each, totaling 1200 images. Machine learning (ML) models and neural networks trained on the MangoDB can classify and evaluate mango fruit quality, helping Farmers and stakeholders to make better harvesting and post-harvest decisions. A TJC Mango Dataset could boost mango farming's profitability and sustainability with AI. In agriculture, grading significantly will benefit from detailed TJC mango images. Photos were taken with a NIKON D5500 DSLR at ISO 2500, 1/100 sec shutter speed, and 24mm focal length. The photos were in NEF format. Classification algorithms like Fast Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) can be used qualitatively to analyze the TJC mango's quality descriptors (colour, surface texture).

An increase of 3.3% in consumption is predicted from 2024 to 2032. Tomatoes are also rich in iron, potassium, antioxidant lycopene, vitamins A, C and K which are important for preventing cancer, and maintaining blood pressure and glucose levels. Thus, tomatoes are globally important due to their widespread usage and nutritional value. To face the high demand for tomatoes, it is mandatory to investigate the causes of crop loss and minimize them. Diseases are one of the major causes that adversely affect crop yield and degrade the quality of the tomato fruit. This leads to financial losses and affects the livelihood of farmers. Therefore, automatic disease detection at any stage of the tomato plant is a critical issue. Deep learning models introduced in the literature show promising results, but the models are difficult to implement on handheld devices such as mobile phones due to high computational costs and a large number of parameters. Also, most of the models proposed so far work efficiently for images with plain backgrounds where a clear demarcation exists between the background and leaf region. Moreover, the existing techniques lack in recognizing multiple diseases on the same leaf. To address these concerns, we introduce a customized deep learning-based convolution vision transformer model. The model achieves an accuracy of 93.51% for classifying tomato leaf images with plain as well as complex backgrounds into 13 categories. It requires a space storage of merely 5.8 MB which is 98.93%, 98.33%, and 92.64% less than state-of-the-art visual geometry group, vision transformers, and convolution vision transformer models, respectively. Its training time of 44 min is 51.12%, 74.12%, and 57.7% lower than the above-mentioned models. Thus, it can be deployed on (Internet of Things) IoT-enabled devices, drones, or mobile devices to assist farmers in the real-time monitoring of tomato crops. The periodic monitoring promotes timely action to prevent the spread of diseases and reduce crop loss. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Disease; Mobile Devices; Tomato; Transformer; Blood Pressure; Crops; Deep Learning; Fruits; Internet Of Things; Learning Systems; Losses; Crop Loss; Disease Detection; Leaf Images; Multi-modelling; Space Efficient; Time-efficient; Tomato; Transformer; Transformer Modeling; Convolution,Blood pressure; Crops; Deep learning; Fruits; Internet of things; Learning systems; Losses; Crop loss; Disease detection; Leaf images; Multi-modelling; Space efficient; Time-efficient; Tomato; Transformer; Transformer modeling; Convolution,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191691896

Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful structural biology method for studying protein and macromolecular structures at high resolution in both native and near-native states. Despite the ability to get detailed structural insights into the processes underlying protein function using cryo-EM, there has been hesitancy amongst plant biologists to apply the method for biomolecular interaction studies. This is largely evident from the relatively fewer structural depositions of proteins and protein complexes from plant origin in electron microscopy databank. Even though the progress has been slow, cryo-EM has significantly contributed to our understanding of the molecular biology processes underlying photosynthesis, energy transfer in plants, besides viruses infecting plants.

Nevertheless, a variety of diseases can impact the cultivation of potatoes, resulting in substantial declines in quality and yield. The two most destructive diseases-Late blight and Early blight-have the capacity to drastically decrease the yield of potatoes.

With the increase in world population, the fruit demand has also increased. However, there are various diseases which affect the health of the grapevine leading to loss in its production. In the present study, a pre-trained and fine-tuned VGG16 model has been implemented for precise and accurate grape leaf disease identification. It is crucial to determine the health and growth of grapevines, but the use of advanced computer vision methods can speed up this process. The VGG16 model extracts deep features from the images and allows a faster and non-invasive performance evaluation. In the proposed work, the significance of grape leaf disease detection in viticulture is examined. The study implements the fine-tuned VGG16 model on a Kaggle-based dataset and examines the performance outcomes.

In addition to sugar, sugar beets are important raw materials for chemical and pharmaceutical products, and the residue after sugar extraction can be used to produce agricultural by-products, such as compound feed, which has a high comprehensive utilization value [1]. Field weeds, such as sugar beets, are harmful to crop growth and can compete with crops for sunlight and nutrients. If weeds are not removed in time during crop growth, they cause a decrease in crop yield and quality. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the development of automated machinery for selective weeding operations. The core component of this technology is a vision system that distinguishes between crops and weeds. To address the problems of difficult weed extraction, poor detection, and segmentation of region boundaries in traditional sugar beet detection, an end-to-end encoder–decoder model based on an improved UNet++ for segmentation is proposed in this paper and applied to sugar beet and weed detection. UNet++ can better fuse feature maps from different layers by skipping connections and can effectively preserve the details of sugar beet and weed images. The new model adds an attention mechanism to UNet++ by embedding the attention module into the upsampling process of UNet++ to suppress interference from extraneous noise. The improved model was evaluated on a sugar beet and weed dataset containing 1026 images. The image dataset in this study was obtained from sugar beet and weed images collected at the University of Bonn, Germany. According to the experimental results, the model can significantly eliminate noise and improve segmentation accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Att-nestedunet; Deep Learning; Semantic Segmentation; Sugar Beet; Weed Detection,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190308809

Conventional crop production techniques used by farmers are not sufficient to meet the required food security. Therefore, to increase the crop production with limited resources, they must be acquainted with advanced and efficient agricultural management practices – including accurate information on the environment and especially the soil type for a particular crop to be cultivated. Crop cultivation practices and crop yields depend on the nature and nutrients present in the soil, thus proving that soil classification has a huge significance in sustainable food production. A large variety of soils occur worldwide. The Indian subcontinent includes a large variety of soil types that are derived from a wide variety of rocks and minerals. According to different characteristics, including climate, vegetation, and terrain to name a few, soil resources vary throughout agroecological subregions. Crop forecasting can assist farmers in increasing agricultural output, which in turn helps to support the global food production industry. In order to give researchers, specialists, and scientists full knowledge about the different types of soil found in different locations, soil categorization systems are created. There have been many classification schemes created, and they are all used globally. Based on the physical conditions, these systems categorize soils according to their general behavior. Though the traditional method of soil survey continues as the most popular form of soil mapping and inventory, it is subjective, time-consuming, and laborious. In order to provide new latest insights and a better understanding of soil science in crop cultivation and crop prediction, this chapter provides an elaborate survey on various machine learning classifications and regression techniques explored in this area.

An efficient system is required for monitoring agricultural problems and supporting farmers to identify the crops to be cultivated. Soil is the most important for the living of people on our earth which is a root source for agriculture. Farmers are depending on soil for growing crops which is a warehouse of minerals. Soil is of different types in India. Soil properties and the nature of the soil can vary from one location to another location. The same soil properties cannot be found even within a few distances. Each soil can have different levels of minerals, nutrients and organic matter and can have different characteristics based on the location. So, farmers need to know the soil types and features of various kinds of soils to understand which crops are to be cultivated in that particular soil type in different climate conditions and what kind of pesticides and fertilisers can be used for better crop yield.

Data preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, is conducted before partitioning the data into training, validation, and test sets. Our findings indicate that the EfficientNet-V2 model surpasses its counterparts in performance, attaining the highest validation accuracy of 0.7480 and a comparatively low validation loss of 0.7488. We further explore several strategies to enhance model performance, such as optimizing hyperparameters, employing data augmentation, utilizing early stopping, implementing learning rate scheduling, applying transfer learning, and adopting ensemble techniques. The resulting classifier offers potential benefits to farmers and agricultural specialists in making informed decisions regarding cassava leaf disease management, ultimately leading to improved crop yields and food security. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Countermeasures; Food Security; Identification; Leaf Diseases; Reduction In Yield; Crops; Deep Learning; Image Recognition; Learning Systems; Plants (botany); Statistical Tests; % Reductions; Countermeasure; Disease Classification; Food Security; Identification; Image-based; Leaf Disease; Performance; Reduction In Yield; Substantial Reduction; Food Supply,Crops; Deep learning; Image recognition; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Statistical tests; % reductions; Countermeasure; Disease classification; Food security; Identification; Image-based; Leaf disease; Performance; Reduction in yield; Substantial reduction; Food supply,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188743544

Agriculture gave rise to civilization. As an agrarian country, India’s economy heavily depends on crop output. As a consequence, agriculture may be the cornerstone of every industry in our country. While organizing an agricultural enterprise, each crop must be properly selected. Several variables, the price of crops, the rate of production, and governmental regulations will affect crop selection. One of the challenging issues in the agriculture industry is the estimation of high crop output through the use of machine learning algorithms. Support Vector Regression Algorithm is used for agricultural yield prediction using various parameters. Forecasts are more heavily dependent on West Maharashtra in India. The potential for growth and a variety of production elements, such as climatic factors like rainfall and humidity, soil characteristics like macronutrients, soil type, topography, irrigation, and fertilizer management, all influence crop output. Remote and proximal sensing technologies are being used more often as a result of the requirement for timely and precise sensing of these inputs for big agricultural fields. For a better outcome, algorithms like Bagging, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression are used to produce the best results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accuracy; Agriculture; Crop Yield; Ensemble; Machine Learning; Metrics; Prediction; Support Vector Regression; Yield Prediction; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning Algorithms; Soils; Support Vector Regression; Topography; Accuracy; Agricultural Crops; Agricultural Enterprise; Crop Yield; Ensemble; Machine-learning; Metric; Several Variables; Support Vector Regressions; Yield Prediction; Crops,Forecasting; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Soils; Support vector regression; Topography; Accuracy; Agricultural crops; Agricultural enterprise; Crop yield; Ensemble; Machine-learning; Metric; Several variables; Support vector regressions; Yield prediction; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187704709

Soil test is necessary because excessive or lacking use of manure will destroy the crop plant. Huge quantity and less quantity of fertilizer can affect the crop yield. Earlier, farmer used traditional methods to grow the crops to prepare their own farm in the traditional method which they had learnt from their intimates without noticing the micronutrients present in the soil that can change from time to time. This lead to low productivity because the farmer’s did not have the proper understanding of the soil. Nowadays, there are several methods to analyze the soil sample through soil test laboratories but these methods are time consuming and tidous. However, Image Processing and Convolutional Neural Network is used efficiently to determine the micronutrients and pH level of soil i.e., Zinc(Zn), Iron(Fe), pH, Manganese(Mn) and Copper(Cu). The soil images were captured manually from Udupi Soil Health Lab. The system is divided into five sections i.e., Image capturing, Image Pre-Processing, Image Segmentation, Training System and Result. Soil images are captured using Smartphone and are provided as an input to the system, from the input images HSV values (Hue Saturation Value) are extracted and these HSV values(Hue Saturation Value) are given as an input to Convolutional Neural Network and as a result soil micronutrients value of the input image is displayed. Based on the result, the soil micronutrients and Accuracy of the model is calculated and displayed.

Therefore, identification of the genes governing the root traits is an essential research component. With regard to the identification of root-associated genes/proteins, the existing wet-lab experiments are resource intensive and the gene expression studies are species-specific. Thus, we proposed a supervised learning-based computational method for the identification of root-associated proteins. Methods: The problem was formulated as a binary classification, where the root-associated proteins and non-root-associated proteins constituted the two classes. Four different machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and adaptive boosting were employed for the classification of proteins of the two classes. Sequence-derived features such as AAC, DPC, CTD, PAAC, and ACF were used as input for the learning algorithms. Results: The SVM achieved higher accuracy with the 250 selected features of AAC+DPC+CTD than that of other possible combinations of feature sets and learning algorithms. Specifically, SVM with the selected features achieved overall accuracies of 0.74, 0.73, and 0.73 when evaluated with single 5-fold cross-validation (5F-CV), repeated 5F-CV, and independent test set, respectively. Conclusions: A web-enabled prediction tool SVM-Root (https://iasri-sg.icar.gov.in/svmroot/) has been developed for the computational prediction of the root-associated proteins.

Although humans can identify the fruit damage caused by pests and diseases, the methods used are inconsistent, time-consuming, and variable. The surface features of fruits typically observed by consumers who seek their health benefits affect their market value. The issue of pest and disease infections further deteriorates fruits' quality, becoming a mounting stressor on farmers since they reduce the potential revenue from fruit production, processing, and export. This article reviews various studies on detecting and classifying damages in fruits. Specifically, we review articles where state-of-the-art approaches under segmentation, image processing, machine learning, and deep learning have proved effective in developing automated systems that address hurdles associated with manual methods of assessing damage using visual experiences.

The carbon uptake by plants in this process is defined as gross primary productivity (GPP). A part of this assimilated carbon is used by the plants to support their physiological activities which are defined as the respiration. The sequestration of carbon by the terrestrial ecosystems holds significance as a vital element of Earth's carbon cycle and constitutes a major sink for the climate change mitigation. The crop yield of any agricultural field is directly linked with its GPP which is important in the aspect of food security and economy. Hence, quantifying the GPP of terrestrial ecosystems is an active branch of study and several methods have been used to address this. In recent times, the machine learning (ML) methods connecting the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) have gained increased interest and different such methods are being used to address different scientific and technological problems. In addition to the traditional methods, several ML techniques have also been explored by several researchers for the GPP estimation. Studies have shown that ML models can produce GPP predictions with more accuracy. A comprehensive review of these methods will be helpful for the researchers due to a rapid development in this field.

However, geographical differences in the effects of biochar on cereal production and greenhouse gas emissions are not well understood at the global scale. Random forest, a classic machine learning algorithm, was employed to reveal the drivers of geographical differences in the effects of biochar on cereals yield and greenhouse gas emissions. The potential for yield increases and greenhouse gas emission reduction was predicted in this study. The results indicate that nitrogen fertilizer rate is the most important factor determining the impact of biochar on cereal yield, while biochar application rate strongly affected greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, the maximum increase in cereal crop yields under biochar application was 14.1%. To achieve the largest increment globally, recommended values of biochar application, mineral nitrogen application rate and pyrolysis temperature were predicted to be around 36.3 t ha−1, 193.7 kg N ha−1 and 420 °C, respectively. The maximum reductions of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from paddy fields around the world were 21.6% and 31.0%, and from maize and wheat fields 35.7% and 36.1%, respectively.

Take care of and maintain the plants in real-time to enhance human survival. Diseases in plants can directly lead to a reduction in the industrial economy. Automatic detection of plant diseases is crucial for effective disease control. Vitis vinifera (Grapes) is an essential crop with rich vitamin C nutrients. This paper targets to classify the major diseases in Vitis vinifera leaves using Capsule Network (CapsNet), that prevails over the significant CNN limitations by discarding the pooling layers and adding capsule layers. Dynamic routing techniques of CapsNet make are more robust for the affine transformation of the leaves dataset. It is capable of learning large datasets effectively with vital image transformations such as rotations and transitions. Implementing CapsNet for Vitis vinifera leaf disease classification, which utilizes dynamic routing between capsules, is a novel method. The proposed CapsNet for disease classification is trained with augmented and non-augmented datasets. The performance metrics highlight that the proposed method can effectively classify the Vitis vinifera plant leaves with 98.7% of validation accuracy.

Like the other plant diseases, grapes plants are also affected some diseases. In order to protect the grapes crop from such diseases, time-to-time monitoring is required. Moreover, some remedies actions can be used at early stages for disease detection. Hence, it is a challenging task to detect grape leaf diseases in their early stages. In this article, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to identify different types of diseases in grape crops. Thereafter, a Gaussian noise features are included during the training, by which an improvement in the training accuracy has been observed.

Mostly, agricultural production has been highly dependent on natural resources like soil, water, and other related natural minerals from the soil. Soil classification is a way of arranging soils that have similar characteristics into groups. Identifying and classifying soils has a great role to play in agricultural productivity as it helps to provide relevant information which aids agricultural experts to recommend the type of crop best suited for a specific type of soil. This study mainly concentrated on classifying soil types such as clay soil, loam soil, sandy soil, peat soil, silt soil, and chalk soil. The soil images were collected from Amhara region at different locations by using a sony digital camera. To reduce image noise due to handshake we used a camera stand or arm to avoid other types of noises like environmental lighting effects and shadow. Once the dataset was collected, preprocessing such as resizing and gamma correction was performed to remove noise from the images, and contrast adjustment was also performed. Experimental research was applied as a general methodology and the experiment was conducted based on two approaches. The first approach used CNN as an end-to-end classifier and the second used a hybrid approach which used CNN as a feature extractor and SVM as a classifier. When CNN was used as an end-to-end classifier, a classification accuracy of 88% was achieved, whereas when the hybrid approach which used CNN as feature extractor and SVM as classifier was employed, a classification accuracy of 95% was achieved. Finally, we conclude that the hybrid approach is better than that of the End-to-End classification using our proposed model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cnn; Pca; Soil Type Identification; Svm; Agriculture; Classification (of Information); Clay; Support Vector Machines; Classification Accuracy; End To End; Feature Extractor; Hybrid Approach; Identification Modeling; Pca; Soil Type Identification; Soil Types; Svm; Vision Learning; Computer Vision,Agriculture; Classification (of information); Clay; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; End to end; Feature extractor; Hybrid approach; Identification modeling; PCA; Soil type identification; Soil types; SVM; Vision learning; Computer vision,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159708987

Early and precise detection is important for effective disease management. Moreover, Squeeze-and-Excitation networks (SENets) significantly enhance convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by leveraging channel-wise dependencies within feature maps. This paper introduces a novel approach for automated ALD analysis using a deep hybrid attention network (DHAN) constructed with CNNs and SENets. The CNN component usually captures spatial features from leaf images, while the SENet attention component leverages channel dependencies within the feature representations. We apply this feature re-calibration, generated from the SENet-based attention mechanism, among all feature maps, including residual or identity connection.

The genus Citrus, which contains a range of fruits distinguished by its unique perfume, high vitamin C content, and refreshing taste, is home to the group of fruits known as citrus fruits. They are widely cultivated and consumed around the world. Citrus fruits, beloved for their refreshing taste and high nutritional value, can face significant challenges from various diseases that impact both the trees and the fruit they bear. Among these diseases, citrus canker stands out as a bacterial affliction causing raised lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit. Though various technological advancements have replaced various industries, the agriculture sector cannot be replaced. Lack of proper planning and forecasting techniques leads to poor yield and wastage of the crops produced. Deep learning is widely employed for such classification. In this paper, we have used pre-trained Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models such as AlexNet and LeNet Architecture. It gave feasible result when it was retrained with a dataset of 2029 images. This model classifies the fruits and leaves into 7 categories. After classifying the fruits, the output to send to the hardware implementation and pesticide and water spraying is triggered based on logical combinations of Arduino as well as taking into consideration the output of the soil moisture sensor. This project aims to improve the crop yield by early detection of diseases and provides an automated pesticide spraying system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Arduino; Cnn; Deep Learning; Image Classification; Iot; Soil Moisture Sensor; Citrus Fruits; Convolutional Neural Networks; Diseases; Fertilizers; Insecticides; Arduino; Convolution Neural Network; Deep Learning; Global Economies; Images Classification; Iot; Pesticide Spraying; Soil Moisture Sensors; Spraying System; Vitamin C; Soil Moisture,Citrus fruits; Convolutional neural networks; Diseases; Fertilizers; Insecticides; Arduino; Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Global economies; Images classification; IoT; Pesticide spraying; Soil moisture sensors; Spraying system; Vitamin C; Soil moisture,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002727258

Agriculture, the most traditional method for sustainable survival, remains essential. Soil health directly impacts agricultural productivity but faces numerous challenges due to the influx of pollutants from both natural and human activities. While supplementing soil with nutrients and minerals can improve its health, pollution poses a significant obstacle. Unhealthy soil, even with added nutrients, cannot enhance productivity due to factors such as heavy metal pollution. Industries such as processing, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and natural processes introduce heavy metals into the soil, which persist for years. The hazardous and indestructible nature of heavy metals necessitates their removal. Various chemical and physical methods exist, but they are costly and generate substantial waste, leading to the need for waste management systems. This situation has pushed researchers to find alternative, cost-effective, and eco-friendly ways to eliminate pollutants. Microorganisms have emerged as a promising solution. They are part of the ecosystem, environmentally friendly, and require minimal investment, making them a preferred choice. This chapter explores the crucial role of microbial degradation in remediating heavy metal pollution and restoring soil health. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bioremediation; Heavy Metal Pollution; Soil Health,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001744341

Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming, errorprone, and require expert knowledge. In this study, we propose a novel approach for detecting multiple diseases in sugarcane leaves using a combination of transfer learning and a custom hybrid model. Initially, pre-trained models like MobileNet and DenseNet are fine-tuned on a sugarcane disease dataset to leverage the feature extraction capabilities of transfer learning. We then propose a new model, the MobileNet-DenseNet Concatenation (MobileNet-DenseNet Concat), which combines the strengths of both architectures. This hybrid model fuses the lightweight, efficient nature of MobileNet with the deep feature extraction capabilities of DenseNet, creating a robust model for multidisease classification. The model is trained and evaluated on a labeled sugarcane disease dataset, and its performance is compared with individual transfer learning models. The proposed model achieves improved 96% accuracy, precision, recall, and F<inf>1</inf> scores, outperforming existing approaches in detecting multiple diseases simultaneously. Additionally, techniques like bounding boxes are used to localize disease regions on the leaves. The results demonstrate that the MobileNet-DenseNet Concat model offers a promising solution for automating sugarcane disease detection, potentially benefiting farmers and agronomists by facilitating early intervention and treatment strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agriculture; Diseases; Mobilenet-densenet Concate; Plant; Sugarcane; Transfer Learning; Adversarial Machine Learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated Learning; Fruits; Sugar Cane; Transfer Learning; Crop Yield; Disease Classification; Disease Detection; Extraction Capability; Features Extraction; Hybrid Model; Mobilenet-densenet Concate; Plant; Sugarcane; Plant Diseases,Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Fruits; Sugar cane; Transfer learning; Crop yield; Disease classification; Disease detection; Extraction capability; Features extraction; Hybrid model; Mobilenet-densenet concate; Plant; Sugarcane; Plant diseases,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001585064

These diseases trigger diverse signalling pathways. Specific genes and proteins, are upregulated in response to pathogen invasion, enabling plants to mount targeted defence responses. Understanding these mechanisms highlights opportunities for enhancing disease resistance through breeding and genetic research in legume crops. This paper outlines a procedure for identification of diseases in pulse crops using modern image processing technologies and machine learning techniques. The objective is to build a system that can recognize the common ailments of pulses which would otherwise lead to a huge loss in case of the weeds not being controlled.

The PWN has caused much extensive damage to pine-dominated forest ecosystems. Trunk injection of emamectin benzoate (EB) has been found to be the most useful protective measure against the PWN, due to its low effective dose and long residence time in the field. However, the interactions between EB and the host or the environment remain largely unknown, which limits the efficacy and stability of EB in practical field settings. In this study, we investigated the impact on PWN from EB injection for both adult and young host plants (Pinus massoniana) by taking a multi-omics (phenomics, transcriptomics, microbiome, and metabolomics) approach. We found that EB injection can significantly reduce the amount of PWN in both living adult and young pine trees. Additionally, EB was able to activate the genetic response of P. massoniana against PWN, promotes P. massoniana growth and development and resistance to Pine wilt disease, which requires the presence of PWN. Further, the presence of EB greatly increased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the host plant in a PWN-dependent manner, possibly by affecting ROS-related microbes and metabolites. Moreover, we uncovered the function of EB limiting the consumption of P. massoniana by the JPS. Based on biochemical and gut microbial data, we found that EB can significantly reduces cellulase activity in JPS, whose transcription factors, sugar metabolism, and the phosphotransferase system are also affected. These results document the impact of EB on the entire PWD transmission chain through multi-omics regarding the dominant pine (P. massoniana) in China and provide a novel perspective for controlling PWD outbreaks in the field. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benzoic Acid; Endo 1,3(4) Beta Glucanase; Antinematodal Agents; Emamectin Benzoate; Reactive Oxygen Species; Hieff; Hiseq; Low Rox Plus; Nanodrop 2000; Powerplant; Primescript; Quantstudio 6 Flex; Sybr Green; Ultimate 3000; Antinematodal Agent; Benzoic Acid; Emamectin Benzoate; Endo 1,3(4) Beta Glucanase; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Unclassified Drug; Adult; Agar Gel Electrophoresis; Animal Experiment; Antiinflammatory Activity; Article; Bioaccumulation; Bursaphelenchus Xylophilus; Cerambycidae; Controlled Study; Dna Extraction; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Sequence; Image Analysis; Limit Of Quantitation; Male; Metabolomics; Metagenome; Microbiome; Monochamus Alternatus; Nonhuman; Pestalotiopsis; Phenomics; Pinus Massoniana; Plant Growth; Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sampling; Seed Inoculation; Seedling; Transcriptomics; Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography; Animal; Beetle; Ecosystem; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetics; Pine; Plant Disease; Animals; Antinematodal Agents; Coleoptera; Ecosystem; Gene Expression Profiling; Pinus; Plant Diseases; Reactive Oxygen Species","antinematodal agent; benzoic acid; emamectin benzoate; endo 1,3(4) beta glucanase; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; adult; agar gel electrophoresis; animal experiment; antiinflammatory activity; Article; bioaccumulation; Bursaphelenchus xylophilus; Cerambycidae; controlled study; DNA extraction; female; gene expression; gene sequence; image analysis; limit of quantitation; male; metabolomics; metagenome; microbiome; Monochamus alternatus; nonhuman; Pestalotiopsis; phenomics; Pinus massoniana; plant growth; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sampling; seed inoculation; seedling; transcriptomics; ultra performance liquid chromatography; animal; beetle; ecosystem; gene expression profiling; genetics; pine; plant disease; Animals; Antinematodal Agents; Coleoptera; Ecosystem; Gene Expression Profiling; Pinus; Plant Diseases; Reactive Oxygen Species",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180304910

The quantification is standardized with leaf organs, defined as individual scoring units. This study focuses on identifying and segmenting individual leaves in agricultural fields using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), multispectral imagery of sugar beet fields, and deep instance segmentation networks (Mask R-CNN). Five strategies for achieving network robustness with limited labeled images are tested and compared, employing simple and copy-paste image augmentation techniques. The study also evaluates the impact of environmental conditions on network performance. Metrics of performance show that multispectral UAV images recorded under sunny conditions lead to a performance drop. Focusing on the practical application, we employ Mask R-CNN models in an image-processing pipeline to calculate leaf-based parameters including DS and DI. The pipeline was applied in time-series in an experimental trial with five varieties and two fungicide strategies to illustrate epidemiological development. Disease severity calculated with the model with highest Average Precision (AP) shows the strongest correlation with the same parameter assessed by experts. The time-series development of disease severity and disease incidence demonstrates the advantages of multispectral UAV-imagery in contrasting varieties for resistance, as well as the limits for disease control measurements. This study identifies key components for automatic leaf segmentation of diseased plants using UAV imagery, such as illumination and disease condition.

Sugarcane is a globally important crop and a major source of sugar, ethanol and jaggery. One of the problems faced by the sugar cane industry is the diseases that attack the crops. If these diseases are not identified early, they may result in exterminating the whole crops surrounding them. Manually checking each and every corner of a large farm is physically impossible. Machine learning is the contemporary solution to the problem, which can be resolved using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) techniques. The drone images of all corners of the farm can be fed into the trained model for distinguishing the health status. For training the model the secondary data is taken from Kaggle, which includes both healthy and unhealthy sugarcane plant images, with various diseases in the unhealthy class. Machine learning models effectively identify early-stage crop diseases. This helps the farmer to treat that part of the affected farm quickly in order to avoid the spread of the disease to the remaining parts of the farm. This study deals with sugarcane disease prediction using the CNN model. Two different layered CNN models (VGG-16 and VGG-19) that were tested. The models were trained based on the images of 2165 containing both healthy and unhealthy leaves. The whole dataset is divided into three parts, validating data, testing data, and training data.

Here, we used AlphaFold-Multimer (AFM) to screen 1879 SSPs of seven tomato pathogens for interacting with six defence-related hydrolases of tomato. This screen of 11,274 protein pairs identified 15 non-annotated SSPs that are predicted to obstruct the active site of chitinases and proteases with an intrinsic fold. Four SSPs were experimentally verified to be inhibitors of pathogenesis-related subtilase P69B, including extracellular protein-36 (Ecp36) and secreted-into-xylem-15 (Six15) of the fungal pathogens Cladosporium fulvum and Fusarium oxysporum, respectively. Together with a P69B inhibitor from the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas perforans and Kazal-like inhibitors of the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, P69B emerges as an effector hub targeted by different microbial kingdoms, consistent with a diversification of P69B orthologs and paralogs.

Real-time macronutrient analysis using the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) is essential for crop and fertilizer optimization because soil quality is crucial to plant growth and productivity. This study proposes a novel parallel-hybrid CNN-LSTM model with Bayesian optimization for smart agriculture soil nutrient management. Modern farming relies on resource efficiency and waste reduction. IoT technology helps farmers integrate smart farming practices for real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making. With IoT sensors, soil data like macronutrient levels, soil temperature, and pH values are continuously collected to assess soil health. The hybrid model better captures spatial patterns and temporal dependencies in sequential data, matching soil nutrient and environmental data. Based on real-time soil nutrient data, the proposed approach identified suitable crops and fertilizers with 99.12% accuracy after rigorous experimentation and evaluation. The parallel-hybrid CNN-LSTM model and Bayesian optimization make precise and timely decisions for optimal crop growth and resource management in smart agriculture, as shown by this high accuracy rate. This strategy aims to boost agricultural productivity, sustainability, and resource efficiency to create a more resilient and eco-friendly agricultural ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Internet Of Things (iot); Macro-nutrient; Npk; Sensors; Soil Nutrients; Crops; Decision Making; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Farms; Fertilizers; Food Supply; Long Short-term Memory; Nutrients; Quality Control; Soils; Sustainable Development; Bayesian Optimization; Internet Of Thing; Macro Nutrients; Npk; Optimisations; Parallel Hybrids; Real- Time; Smart Agricultures; Soil Nutrients; Sustainable Growth; Internet Of Things,Crops; Decision making; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Farms; Fertilizers; Food supply; Long short-term memory; Nutrients; Quality control; Soils; Sustainable development; Bayesian optimization; Internet of thing; Macro nutrients; NPK; Optimisations; Parallel hybrids; Real- time; Smart agricultures; Soil nutrients; Sustainable growth; Internet of things,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194157519

Pathogen-plant interaction experiments focus mainly on single-strain infections, typically ignoring the complexity of multi-strain infections even though mixed infections are common and critical for the infection outcome. The wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici forms highly diverse fungal populations in which several pathogen strains often colonize the same leaf. Despite the importance of mixed infections, the mechanisms governing interactions between a mixture of pathogen strains within a plant host remain largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that avirulent pathogen strains benefit from being in mixed infections with virulent strains. We show that virulent strains suppress the wheat immune response, allowing avirulent strains to colonize the apoplast and to reproduce. Our experiments indicate that virulent strains in mixed infections can suppress the plant immune system, probably facilitating the persistence of avirulent pathogen strains in fields planted with resistant host plants. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Lsm 780; Green Fluorescent Protein; Transcriptome; Apoplast; Article; Autofluorescence; Biofilm; Coinfection; Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy; Controlled Study; Differential Gene Expression; Fungal Biomass; Fungus Growth; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Image Analysis; Immune Response; Immune System; Nonhuman; Photosynthesis; Plant Immunity; Plant Response; Principal Component Analysis; Rna Extraction; Rna Isolation; Rna Sequence; Transcriptomics; Triticum Aestivum; Zymoseptoria Tritici; Host Pathogen Interaction; Microbiology; Plant; Plant Disease; Coinfection; Host-pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plants,green fluorescent protein; transcriptome; apoplast; Article; autofluorescence; biofilm; coinfection; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; differential gene expression; fungal biomass; fungus growth; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; image analysis; immune response; immune system; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant immunity; plant response; principal component analysis; RNA extraction; RNA isolation; RNA sequence; transcriptomics; Triticum aestivum; Zymoseptoria tritici; host pathogen interaction; microbiology; plant; plant disease; Coinfection; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plants,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85179715234

To guarantee the sustainable growth of the sugarcane industry and boost sustainable energy reserves, it is imperative to forecast the yield in the primary sugarcane production regions. However, due to environmental differences caused by regional differences and changeable climate, the accuracy of traditional models is generally low. In this study, we counted the environmental information and yield of the main sugarcane-producing areas in the past 15 years, adopted the LSSVM algorithm to construct the environmental information and sugarcane yield model, and combined it with WCA to optimize the parameters of LSSVM. To verify the validity of the proposed model, WCA-LSSVM is applied to two instances based on temporal differences and geographical differences and compared with other models. The results show that the accuracy of the WCA-LSSVM model is much better than that of other yield prediction models. The RMSE of the two instances are 5.385 ton/ha and 5.032 ton/ha, respectively, accounting for 7.65% and 6.92% of the average yield. And the other evaluation indicators MAE, R2, MAPE, and SMAPE are also ahead of the other models to varying degrees. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis of environmental variables at different growth stages of sugarcane and found that in addition to the main influencing factors (temperature and precipitation), soil humidity at different depths had a significant impact on crop yield. In conclusion, this study presents a highly precise model for predicting sugarcane yield, a useful tool for planning sugarcane production, enhancing yield, and advancing the field of agricultural production prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Production; Artificial Intelligence; Crop Production; Machine Learning; Parameter Optimization; Sensitivity Analysis,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178374404

However, in recent years, various sugarcane diseases have emerged, severely impacting the national economy. To address the issue of identifying diseases in sugarcane leaf sections, this paper proposes the SE-VIT hybrid network. Unlike traditional methods that directly use models for classification, this paper compares threshold, K-means, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms for extracting leaf lesions from images. Due to SVM's ability to accurately segment these lesions, it is ultimately selected for the task. The paper introduces the SE attention module into ResNet-18 (CNN), enhancing the learning of inter-channel weights. After the pooling layer, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) is incorporated. Finally, with the inclusion of 2D relative positional encoding, the accuracy is improved by 5.1%, precision by 3.23%, and recall by 5.17%. The SE-VIT hybrid network model achieves an accuracy of 97.26% on the PlantVillage dataset. Additionally, when compared to four existing classical neural network models, SE-VIT demonstrates significantly higher accuracy and precision, reaching 89.57% accuracy. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can provide technical support for intelligent management of sugarcane plantations and offer insights for addressing plant diseases with limited datasets.

However, their mechanism of pathogenicity requires clarity to help control their infections. Here, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted by integrating genomic data and measurements of two phenotypes (virulence and cellulase activity) for 120 various Pectobacterium strains in order to identify the genetic basis of their pathogenicity. An artificial intelligence-based software program was developed to automatically measure lesion areas on Chinese cabbage, thereby facilitating accurate and rapid data collection for virulence phenotypes for use in GWAS analysis. The analysis discovered 428 and 158 loci significantly associated with Pectobacterium virulence (lesion area) and cellulase activity, respectively. In addition, 1,229 and 586 epistasis loci pairs were identified for the virulence and cellulase activity phenotypes, respectively. Among them, the AraC transcriptional regulator exerted epistasis effects with another three nutrient transport-related genes in pairs contributing to the virulence phenotype, and their epistatic effects were experimentally confirmed for one pair with knockout mutants of each single gene and double gene. This study consequently provides valuable insights into the genetic mechanism underlying Pectobacterium spp. pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE Plant diseases and pests are responsible for the loss of up to 40% of food crops, and annual economic losses caused by plant diseases reach more than $220 billion. Fighting against plant diseases requires an understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of pathogens. This study adopted an advanced approach using population genomics integrated with virulence-related phenotype data to investigate the genetic basis of Pectobacterium spp., which causes serious crop losses worldwide. An automated software program based on artificial intelligence was developed to measure the virulence phenotype (lesion area), which greatly facilitated this research. The analysis predicted key genomic loci that were highly associated with virulence phenotypes, exhibited epistasis effects, and were further confirmed as critical for virulence with mutant gene deletion experiments. The present study provides new insights into the genetic determinants associated with Pectobacterium pathogenicity and provides a valuable new software resource that can be adapted to improve plant infection measurements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Epistasis; Genome-wide Association Studies (gwas); Pathogenicity; Pectobacterium Spp; Cellulase; Gentamicin; Kanamycin; Linoleic Acid; Rifampicin; Easypure; Novaseq 6000; Tli Rnaseh Plus; Arac Protein; Cellulase; Gentamicin; Kanamycin; Linoleic Acid; Rifampicin; Transcription Factor; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Bacterial Strain; Bacterial Virulence; Bioinformatics; Epistasis; Escherichia Coli; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression; Gene Structure; Genome-wide Association Study; Genotyping; Nonhuman; Pathogenicity; Pectobacterium; Pectobacterium Carotovorum; Phenotype; Phylogenetic Tree; Plasmid; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Regulator Gene; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Soft Rot,AraC protein; cellulase; gentamicin; kanamycin; linoleic acid; rifampicin; transcription factor; Article; artificial intelligence; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bioinformatics; epistasis; Escherichia coli; gene deletion; gene expression; gene structure; genome-wide association study; genotyping; nonhuman; pathogenicity; Pectobacterium; Pectobacterium carotovorum; phenotype; phylogenetic tree; plasmid; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulator gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; soft rot,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175817814

Wheat, barley, and canola are important crops that are grown and traded globally. However, climate change, geopolitical tensions and competition from other crops threaten the ability to satisfy global demand. Accurate predictions of crop production and its spatial variation can play a significant role in their reliable and efficient production, marketing, and distribution. OBJECTIVE: This review examined recently published models and data used to predict wheat, barley, and canola yield to identify which factors produced the best yield predictions. METHODS: A literature search was conducted across the Scopus, EBSCOhost and Web of Science databases over seven years between 2015 and 2021. Data extracted from the papers identified by the literature search were investigated using graphical and quantitative analytical techniques to determine if the type of algorithm, input data, prediction timing, output scale or extent and climate variability both in isolation and in combination affected the model's predictive ability. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The literature search produced 11, 908 results which was reduced to 118 papers after applying the review criteria (peer reviewed papers focussed on models predicting yield at greater than plot scale across extensive areas using accessible data). China produced almost one third of all yield prediction models over the study period and 87% of models were used to predict wheat yield. Statistical models were the most common algorithm in most regions and in total. However, there was a surge in machine learning models after 2018. They were the most common model from 2019 to 2021, with one third developed in China. The review concluded that only the choice of modelling technique and the input data had a significant effect on model performance with the machine learning techniques Random Forest, Boosting algorithms and Deep Learning models as well as process-based Light Use Efficiency models that used a combination of remotely sensed and agrometeorological data performing best. SIGNIFICANCE: The review showed that matching the model to the available data could improve the ability to predict wheat, barley or canola yield. The use of quantitative statistical techniques in this review, should give modellers trying to predict wheat, barley or canola yield more confidence in matching their approach to the available data than previous reviews that relied on visual interpretation of data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agrometeorological Data; Model Performance; Quantitative Analysis; Remotely Sensed Data; Review; Yield Prediction Models; Agrometeorology; Barley; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Data Set; Literature Review; Machine Learning; Maize; Quantitative Analysis; Satellite Data; Spatial Variation; China,agrometeorology; barley; crop production; crop yield; data set; literature review; machine learning; maize; quantitative analysis; satellite data; spatial variation; China,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169797464

However, diseases caused by agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and phytoplasmas cause considerable economic damage to these crops. Existing methods for cassava disease detection require farmers to seek the assistance of agricultural experts for visual inspection and diagnosis, which is challenging and laborious. Most studies have employed pre-trained convolutional neural networks to detect diseases in cassava leaves. Also, it is essential to design customized deep neural networks specific to the target domain for precise classification. This research proposes a novel deep fusion of two networks, residual channel shuffled attention network and Efficientnet. The first network, RCSANet, was presented to capture contextual information using depthwise separable convolution effectively. It also integrates significant inter-spatial and inter-channel information using the triplet attention module and employs shuffled group convolution to capture features from distinct filter groups. As a result of incorporating the above architectural enhancements, the proposed feature fusion network exhibited better performance than the existing studies. The proposed network was trained on the Kaggle cassava leaf disease dataset with 21,367 samples and yielded a classification accuracy of 93.25%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attention; Deep Learning; Hybrid Features; Multi-path Network; Plant Disease; Agriculture; Classification (of Information); Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Neural Networks; Diagnosis; Information Use; Plants (botany); Viruses; Attention; Deep Learning; Economic Damages; Features Fusions; Hybrid Features; Leaf Disease Detections; Multi-path Network; Multipath; Phytoplasmas; Plant Disease; Convolution,Agriculture; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Information use; Plants (botany); Viruses; Attention; Deep learning; Economic damages; Features fusions; Hybrid features; Leaf disease detections; Multi-path network; Multipath; Phytoplasmas; Plant disease; Convolution,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168369431

Recent advances in remote sensing technology and data processing have propelled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into valuable tools for obtaining detailed data on plant diseases with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. Given the growing body of scholarly research centered on UAV-based disease detection, a comprehensive review and analysis of current studies becomes imperative to provide a panoramic view of evolving methodologies in plant disease monitoring and to strategically evaluate the potential and limitations of such strategies. This study undertakes a systematic quantitative literature review to summarize existing literature and discern current research trends in UAV-based applications for plant disease detection and monitoring. Results reveal a global disparity in research on the topic, with Asian countries being the top contributing countries (43 out of 103 papers). World regions such as Oceania and Africa exhibit comparatively lesser representation. To date, research has largely focused on diseases affecting wheat, sugar beet, potato, maize, and grapevine. Multispectral, reg-green-blue, and hyperspectral sensors were most often used to detect and identify disease symptoms, with current trends pointing to approaches integrating multiple sensors and the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Future research should prioritize (i) development of cost-effective and user-friendly UAVs, (ii) integration with emerging agricultural technologies, (iii) improved data acquisition and processing efficiency (iv) diverse testing scenarios, and (v) ethical considerations through proper regulations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Disease Monitoring; Image Processing; Machine Learning; Plant Disease; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Agricultural Technology; Aircraft Detection; Antennas; Cost Effectiveness; Data Acquisition; Data Handling; Deep Learning; Image Processing; Learning Systems; Remote Sensing; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); 'current; Aerial Vehicle; Disease Detection; Disease Monitoring; Images Processing; Machine-learning; Plant Disease; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing Technology; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Sugar Beets,Agricultural technology; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Data acquisition; Data handling; Deep learning; Image processing; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 'current; Aerial vehicle; Disease detection; Disease monitoring; Images processing; Machine-learning; Plant disease; Precision Agriculture; Remote sensing technology; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Sugar beets,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85170386156

This study employed a machine learning approach to predict root yield and quality parameters based on the nutrient status of sugar beet leaves in relation to nitrogen fertilization. The field experiment included the following N fertilization treatments for sugar beet production: control (N0), presowing (N1 = 45 kg N ha−1) and presowing with top-dressing (N2 = 99 and 154.5 kg ha−1). Leaf samples were collected during the vegetation period in six intervals (May-Sept) to determine the levels of N, K and Na in the leaf dry matter. The machine learning regression based on ensemble decision trees and artificial neural network was used to determine the relationship of leaf samples based on varying N fertilization with yield parameters. Among the leaf elements analyzed, Na exhibited the highest average relative variable importance for root yield, sucrose content, and other quality parameters during the season with greater precipitation. In the season with less precipitation, N content at the beginning of July showed higher importance on root yield (74.6).

Previous studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have shown the critical roles of the CAM-BINDING PROTEIN 60 (CBP60) protein family in plant growth, stress responses, and immunity. Certain CBP60 factors can regulate plant immune responses, like pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity, and synthesis of major plant immune-activating metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). Although homologous CBP60 sequences have been identified in the plant kingdom, their function and regulation in most species remain unclear. In this paper, we specifically characterized 11 members of the CBP60 family in the agriculturally important crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Protein sequence analyses revealed that three CBP60 homologs have the closest amino acid identity to Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1, master transcription factors involved in plant immunity. Strikingly, AlphaFold deep learning–assisted prediction of protein structures highlighted close structural similarity between these tomato and Arabidopsis CBP60 homologs. Conserved domain analyses revealed that they possess CAM-binding domains and DNA-binding domains, reflecting their potential involvement in linking Ca2+ signaling and transcriptional regulation in tomato plants. In terms of their gene expression profiles under biotic (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 pathogen infection) and/or abiotic stress (warming temperatures), five tomato CBP60 genes were pathogen-responsive and temperature-sensitive, reminiscent of Arabidopsis CBP60g and SARD1. Overall, we present a genome-wide identification of the CBP60 gene/protein family in tomato plants, and we provide evidence on their regulation and potential function as Ca2+-sensing transcriptional regulators. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alphafold; Climate Change; Gene Expression; Gene Regulation; Plant Defense; Plant Immunity; Pseudomonas Syringae; Salicylic Acid; Temperature; Tomato; Transcription Factor; Calcium; Salicylic Acid; Arabidopsis Proteins; Calcium; Calmodulin; Calmodulin-binding Proteins; Salicylic Acid; Transcription Factors; Calmodulin Binding Protein; Calmodulin Binding Protein 60; Unclassified Drug; Arabidopsis Protein; Calcium; Calmodulin; Salicylic Acid; Transcription Factor; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Article; Calcium Signaling; Cbp60 Gene; Controlled Study; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Identification; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Plant Gene; Plant Growth; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaf; Plant Structures; Pseudomonas Syringae Pv.

Here, we combined high-spatial-resolution multi-sensor (optical and microwave) remote sensing data to estimate sugarcane yield using two approaches. First, we retrieved the 10 m resolution vegetation optical depth (VOD) using C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data via the water cloud model, then derived a combined VOD and Sentinel-2 derived green–red vegetation index (GRVI, a traditional vegetation index) time series. Second, we adopted the eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm to estimate total sugarcane production based on the aggregated mean monthly VOD and GRVI time series at the county scale. County-scale sugarcane yield data from 81 counties across Guangxi, China (2018–2020) were used for model training and testing. We then kept the trained best-performance model unchanged to re-predict pixel-scale (10-m resolution) yield using VOD and GRVI images. A SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach was employed to test XGBoost knowledge regarding the mechanisms affecting yield. The main outcomes from this study were as follows. (1) The XGBoost model and VOD and GRVI time series unequivocally provided reliable and precise estimates of sugarcane yield, with a low relative error both at the county scale and at the pixel scale. (2) Predictions of sugarcane yield in the growing season using combined VOD and GRVI data yields high accuracy (R2 = 0.815) with specific spatial patterns of sugarcane yields for Guangxi province, and were feasible up to two months prior to harvest. (3) The SHAP model revealed that Sentinel-1 derived VOD data are important for predicting yield. This research portrays the benefits of combining VOD and GRVI data in automatic machine learning models for estimating sugarcane yield at high spatial and temporal resolutions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Machine Learning; Sugarcane Yield Estimation; Vegetation Index; Vegetation Optical Depth; Water Cloud Model; Crop Yield; Machine Learning; Numerical Model; Optical Depth; Pixel; Precision Agriculture; Prediction; Sentinel; Sugar Cane; Vegetation Index; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu,crop yield; machine learning; numerical model; optical depth; pixel; precision agriculture; prediction; Sentinel; sugar cane; vegetation index; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85162056857

However, bacterial, fungal, and other microbial diseases that have a negative effect on the health of plants and crop yield are a major problem for rice farmers. It is challenging to diagnose these diseases manually, especially in areas with a shortage of crop protection experts. Automating disease identification and providing readily available decision-support tools are essential for enabling effective rice leaf protection measures and minimising rice crop losses. Although there are numerous classification systems for the diagnosis of rice leaf disease, no reliable, secure method has been identified that meets these needs. This paper proposes a lightweight federated deep learning architecture while maintaining data privacy constraints for rice leaf disease classification. The distributed client–server design of this framework protects the data privacy of all clients, and by using independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, the validity of the federated deep learning models was examined. To validate the framework’s efficacy, the researchers conducted experiments in a variety of settings, including conventional learning, federated learning via a single client, as well as federated learning via multiple clients. The study began by extracting features from various pre-trained models, ultimately selecting EfficientNetB3 with an impressive 99% accuracy as the baseline model. Subsequently, experimental results were conducted using the federated learning (FL) approach with both IID and non-IID datasets. The FL approach, along with a dense neural network trained and evaluated on an IID dataset, achieved outstanding training and evaluated accuracies of 99% with minimal losses of 0.006 and 0.03, respectively. Similarly, on a non-IID dataset, the FL approach maintained a high training accuracy of 99% with a loss of 0.04 and an evaluation accuracy of 95% with a loss of 0.08. These results indicate that the FL approach performs nearly as well as the base model, EfficientNetB3, highlighting its effectiveness in handling both IID and non-IID data. It was found that federated deep learning models with multiple clients outperformed conventional pre-trained models. The unique characteristics of the proposed framework, such as its data privacy for edge devices with limited resources, set it apart from the existing classification schemes for rice leaf diseases. The framework is the best alternative solution for the early classification of rice leaf disease because of these additional features. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Federated Learning; Iids; Non-iids; Oryza Satival; Rice Leaf Disease; Bacterial Disease; Detection Method; Image Analysis; Rice; Asia,bacterial disease; detection method; image analysis; rice; Asia,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169109042

This paper presents Cycles-L, a landscape-scale agroecosystem and hydrologic modeling system, using as a test case a watershed in Pennsylvania. Cycles-L emerges from melding the landscape and hydrology structure of Flux-PIHM, a 3-D land surface hydrologic model, with the agroecosystem processes in the Cycles model. Consequently, Cycles-L can simulate processes affected by topography, soil heterogeneity, and management practices, owing to its physically-based hydrology that can simulate horizontal and vertical transport of solutes with water. The model was tested at a 730-ha experimental watershed within the Mahantango Creek watershed. Cycles-L simulated well stream water and mineral nitrogen discharge (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient 0.55 and 0.60, respectively) and grain yield (root mean square error 1.2 Mg ha−1). Cycles-L outputs are as good or better than those obtained with the uncoupled Flux-PIHM (water discharge) and Cycles (grain yield) models. Modeled spatial patterns of nitrogen fluxes like denitrification illustrate the combined control of crop management and topography. For example, denitrification is almost twice as high when simulated with Cycles-L than when simulated with Cycles 1-D. Due to its spatial and temporal resolution, Cycles-L fills a gap in the availability of models that operate at a scale relevant to evaluate interventions in the landscape. Cycles-L can become a central component in tools for climate change scenario analysis, precision agriculture, precision conservation, and artificial intelligence-based decision support systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agroecosystem Modeling; Crop Yield; Denitrification; Nitrogen Transport; Spatially Distributed Modeling; Stream Discharge; Agricultural Pollution; Artificial Intelligence; Climate Change; Climate Models; Crops; Decision Support Systems; Drought; Ecosystems; Grain (agricultural Product); Mean Square Error; Nitrogen; Spatial Distribution; Surface Measurement; Topography; Watersheds; Agro-ecosystem Modeling; Agro-ecosystems; Crop Yield; Grain Yield; Hydrologic Models; Land Surface; Landscape Model; Nitrogen Transport; Spatially Distributed Modeling; Stream Discharge; Denitrification; Agricultural Ecosystem; Climate Change; Denitrification; Land Surface; Landscape Ecology; Stream; Watershed; Pennsylvania; United States,Agricultural pollution; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Decision support systems; Drought; Ecosystems; Grain (agricultural product); Mean square error; Nitrogen; Spatial distribution; Surface measurement; Topography; Watersheds; Agro-ecosystem modeling; Agro-ecosystems; Crop yield; Grain yield; Hydrologic models; Land surface; Landscape model; Nitrogen transport; Spatially distributed modeling; Stream discharge; Denitrification; agricultural ecosystem; climate change; denitrification; land surface; landscape ecology; stream; watershed; Pennsylvania; United States,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168255760

In agriculture, plant diseases are mainly responsible for production degradation, which causes economic loss. In plants, citrus is widely utilized as a critical resource of nutrients such as vitamin C. But Citrus disease negatively impacts the quality and production of citrus fruits. Over the last few years, image processing and computer vision technologies have been extensively applied to detect and classify diseases in plants. Mostly, plant disease has clear signs, and today's recognized model is for an expert plant diagnostician to recognize the disease by observing a diseased plant leaf through a microscope. Manual disease detection can be labour-intensive and the efficiency of the diagnoses is associated with the pathologist's skills, which makes this a greater application field for computer-aided diagnosis systems. This work develops an effectual Duck Optimization with Enhanced Capsule Network Based Citrus Disease Detection for Sustainable Crop Management (DOECN-CDDCM) technique. The presented technique majorly focuses on the detection and classification of citrus diseases. In the presented approach, several stages of preprocessing are performed. In addition, the duck optimization algorithm (DOA) with the Enhanced Capsule Network (ECN) model is exploited as a feature extractor, and the optimal hyperparameter tuning process helps obtain enhanced performance. Finally, the deep stacked sparse autoencoder (DSSAE) model is utilized for citrus disease detection and classification. A series of simulations were performed to ensure the enhanced disease detection performance of the DOECN-CDDCM algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate the improvised outcomes of the DOECN-CDDCM algorithm than other current techniques. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Citrus Diseases; Crop Management; Deep Learning; Intelligent Systems; Sustainable Agriculture; Citrus Fruits; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Crops; Deep Learning; Image Processing; Losses; Citrus Disease; Citrus Disease Detection; Crop Managements; Disease Detection; Network-based; Optimisations; Plant Disease; Productive Capacity; Sustainable Agriculture; Intelligent Systems; Agriculture; Alternative Agriculture; Natural Resource; Nutrient; Optimization; Vitamin,Citrus fruits; Computer aided diagnosis; Crops; Deep learning; Image processing; Losses; Citrus disease; Citrus disease detection; Crop managements; Disease detection; Network-based; Optimisations; Plant disease; Productive capacity; Sustainable agriculture; Intelligent systems; agriculture; alternative agriculture; natural resource; nutrient; optimization; vitamin,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166619630

The cucumber is a frequently grown creeping vine plant that has few calories but is high in water and several vital vitamins and minerals. Due to the unfavorable ecological environment and non-biological circumstances, cucumber diseases will adversely harm the quality of cucumber and cause heavy financial loss. Early identification and protection of crop diseases are essential for disease management, crop yield enhancement, cost reduction, and boosting agricultural production. The traditional diagnosis of crop diseases is often time-consuming, laborious, ineffective, and subjective. To cope with this scenario, the development of a machine-based model which can detect cucumber diseases is a demand of time for increasing agricultural production.

Seed quality plays a significant role in obtaining a good yield, but it is difficult to find out seed quality manually. To overcome this problem, Image Processing technology and Machine Learning techniques are used to classify seeds according to their quality. Images are analyzed for texture, morphology, and color of the grain. This paper presents a solution supporting quality analysis using Machine Learning. From the images of the seed, the considered attributes of the dataset are perimeter, area, diameter, and centroid. Also, the attributes of the texture dataset are contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity.

This study aims to improve the quantification of yield, grain protein concentration (GPC), and nitrogen (N) output in winter wheat with RS imagery. Ground-truth wheat traits were measured at flowering and harvest in a field experiment combining four N and two water levels in central Spain over 2 years. Hyperspectral and thermal airborne images coincident with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were acquired at flowering. A parametric linear model using all hyperspectral normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI) and two non-parametric models (artificial neural network and random forest) were used to assess their estimation ability combining NDSIs and other RS indicators. The feasibility of using freely available multispectral satellite was tested by applying the same methodology but using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands. Yield estimation obtained the highest R2 value, showing that the visible and short-wave infrared region (VSWIR) had similar accuracy to the hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 imagery (R2 ≈ 0.84). The SWIR bands were important in the GPC estimation with both sensors, whereas N output was better estimated using red-edge-based NDSIs, obtaining satisfactory results with the hyperspectral sensor (R2 = 0.74) and with the Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.62). When including the Sentinel-2 SWIR index, the NDSI (B11, B3) improved the estimation of N output (R2 = 0.71).

These pathogens are major contributors to loss in numerous food crops. Oomycetes secrete effector proteins tomanipulate their hosts to the advantage of the pathogen. Plants have evolved to recognize effectors, resulting in an evolutionary cycle of defense and counter-defense in plant-microbe interactions. This selective pressure results in highly diverse effector sequences that can be difficult to computationally identify using only sequence similarity. We developed a novel effector prediction tool, EffectorO, that uses two complementary approaches to predict effectors in oomycete pathogen genomes: i) amachine learning-based pipeline that predicts effector probability based on the biochemical properties of the N-Terminal amino-Acid sequence of a protein and ii) a pipeline based on lineage specificity to find proteins that are unique to one species or genus, a sign of evolutionary divergence due to adaptation to the host.We tested EffectorO on Bremia lactucae, which causes lettuce downymildew, and Phytophthora infestans,which causes late blight of potato and tomato, and predicted many novel effector candidates while recovering the majority of known effector candidates. EffectorO will be useful for discovering novel families of oomycete effectors without relying on sequence similarity to known effectors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bioinformatics; Bremia Lactucae; Comparative Genomics; Effector Prediction; Oomycete Pathogens; Phytophthora Infestans; Protein; Proteins; Protein; Evolution; Genetics; Genome; Metabolism; Oomycetes; Peronospora; Phytophthora Infestans; Plant; Plant Disease; Biological Evolution; Genome; Plant Diseases; Plants; Proteins,protein; evolution; genetics; genome; metabolism; Oomycetes; Peronospora; Phytophthora infestans; plant; plant disease; Biological Evolution; Genome; Plant Diseases; Plants; Proteins,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168316005

As a main food, potatoes are prioritised for cultivation worldwide. Because potatoes are such a rich source of vitamins and minerals, we can create a robust system for food security. However, a number of illnesses delay the growth of agriculture and harm potato output. Consequently, early disease identification can offer a better answer for effective crop production. In this research work aim is to classify and detect the potato leave (PL) diseases using OMFA-CNN deep learning model. An optimized matrix feature analysis-CNN deep learning model for PL disease detection is implemented. In the first phase, the PLs features are extracted from the potato leave images using K-means clustering image segmentation method. At the last phase, a new OMFA-CNN model are proposed using CNN to classify virus, and bacterial diseases of PLs, The PL disease dataset consists 2351 images gathered in real-time and from the Kaggle (PlantVillage) dataset.

Site-specific best management practices (BMPs) are being promoted for adoption globally as solutions. However, how SOC and crop yield are related to each other in responding to BMPs remains unknown. Here, path analysis based on meta-analysis and machine learning was conducted to identify the effects and potential mechanisms of how the relationship between SOC and crop yield responds to site-specific BMPs in China. The results showed that BMPs could significantly enhance SOC and maintain or increase crop yield. The maximum benefits in SOC (30.6%) and crop yield (79.8%) occurred in mineral fertilizer combined with organic inputs (MOF). Specifically, the optimal SOC and crop yield would be achieved when the areas were arid, soil pH was ≥7.3, initial SOC content was ≤10 g kg−1, duration was >10 years, and the nitrogen (N) input level was 100–200 kg ha−1. Further analysis revealed that the original SOC level and crop yield change showed an inverted V-shaped structure. The association between the changes in SOC and crop yield might be linked to the positive role of the nutrient-mediated effect. The results generally suggested that improving the SOC can strongly support better crop performance. Limitations in increasing crop yield still exist due to low original SOC level, and in regions where the excessive N inputs, inappropriate tillage or organic input is inadequate and could be diminished by optimizing BMPs in harmony with site-specific conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Crop Yield; Farming Management; Nutrient-mediated Effect; Soil Organic Carbon; Carbon; Carbon; Soil; Agricultural Land; Agricultural Management; Best Management Practice; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Crop Yield; Machine Learning; Meta-analysis; Soil Carbon; Soil Management; Soil Organic Matter; China; Carbon; Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; Chemistry; Crop; Human; Meta Analysis; Procedures; Soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Crops, Agricultural; Humans; Soil","agricultural land; agricultural management; best management practice; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; machine learning; meta-analysis; soil carbon; soil management; soil organic matter; China; carbon; agriculture; carbon sequestration; chemistry; crop; human; meta analysis; procedures; soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Crops, Agricultural; Humans; Soil",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153054120

This research was conducted to provide scientific data support for sugar factories and related management departments, explore the relationship between sugarcane yield and meteorological factors in the main sugarcane producing areas of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. [Methods] The study area included five sugarcane planting regions which laid in five different counties in Guangxi, China. The average yields per hectare of each planting regions were provided by Guangxi Sugar Industry Group which controls the sugar refineries of each planting region. The daily meteorological data including 14 meteorological factors from 2002 to 2019 were acquired from National Data Center for Meteorological Sciences to analyze their influences placed on sugarcane yield. Since meteorological factors could pose different influences on sugarcane growth during different time spans, a new kind of factor which includes meteorological factors and time spans was defined, such as the average precipitation in August, the average temperature from February to April, etc. And then the inter-correlation of all the meteorological factors of different time spans and their correlations with yields were analyzed to screen out the key meteorological factors of sensitive time spans. After that, four algorithms of BP neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and long short-term memory (LSTM) were employed to establish sugarcane apparent yield prediction models for each planting region. Their corresponding reference models based on the annual meteorological factors were also built. Additionally, the meteorological yields of every planting region were extracted by HP filtering, and a general meteorological yield prediction model was built based on the data of all the five planting regions by using RF, SVM BPNN, and LSTM, respectively. [Results and Discussions] The correlation analysis showed that different planting regions have different sensitive meteorological factors and key time spans. The highly representative meteorological factors mainly included sunshine hours, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure. According to the results of correlation analysis, in Region 1, the highest negative correlation coefficient with yield was observed at the sunshine hours during October and November, while the highest positive correlation coefficient was found at the minimum relative humidity in November. In Region 2, the maximum positive correlation coefficient with yield was observed at the average vapor pressure during February and March, whereas the maximum negative correlation coefficient was associated with the precipitation in August and September. In Region 3, the maximum positive correlation coefficient with yield was found at the 20-20 precipitation during August and September, while the maximum negative correlation coefficient was related to sunshine hours in the same period. In Region 4, the maximum positive correlation coefficient with yield was observed at the 20-20 precipitation from March to December, whereas the maximum negative correlation coefficient was associated with the highest atmospheric pressure from August to December. In Region 5, the maximum positive correlation coefficient with yield was found at the average vapor pressure from June and to August, whereas the maximum negative correlation coefficient as related to the lowest atmospheric pressure in February and March. For each specific planting region, the accuracy of apparent yield prediction model based on sensitive meteorological factors during key time spans was obviously better than that based on the annual average meteorological values. The LSTM model performed significantly better than the widely used classic BPNN, SVM, and RF models for both kinds of meteorological factors (under sensitive time spans or annually). The overall root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the LSTM model under key time spans were 10.34 t/ha and 6.85%, respectively, with a coefficient of determination R<inf>v</inf>2 of 0.8489 between the predicted values and true values. For the general prediction models of the meteorological yield to multiple the sugarcane planting regions, the RF, SVM, and BPNN models achieved good results, and the best prediction performance went to BPNN model, with an RMSE of 0.98 t/ha, MAPE of 9.59%, and R<inf>v</inf>2 of 0.965. The RMSE and MAPE of the LSTM model were 0.25 t/ha and 39.99%, respectively, and the R<inf>v</inf>2 was 0.77. [Conclusions] Sensitive meteorological factors under key time spans were found to be more significantly correlated with the yields than the annual average meteorological factors. LSTM model shows better performances on apparent yield prediction for specific planting region than the classic BPNN, SVM, and RF models, but BPNN model showed better results than other models in predicting meteorological yield over multiple sugarcane planting regions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bpnn Model; Hp Filter; Lstm Model; Machine Learning; Meteorological Factor; Sugarcane Yield,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169894791

The significant yields it offers, coupled with low cultivation inputs and substantial nutritional benefits - including high protein content and minimal sugar levels, necessitate precision in yield predictions and growth management. This, in turn, fosters the evolution of mechanized agriculture and automation. To address this need, a novel methodology amalgamating digital image processing and machine learning algorithms has been established to accurately determine the mineral nutrient content in Dioscorea leaves. This methodology initiates with the separation of the foreground and background in leaf images, achieved through the implementation of the H-component OTSU algorithm. Subsequently, the computation of 54 color features is carried out, and machine learning techniques are harnessed to form models that delineate image features in correlation with a SPAD value exceeding 0.9. The aspiration of this model development lies in the prediction of chlorophyll, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content in Dioscorea leaves. It has been determined that the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), post 100 iterations, constructs the most accurate model for predicting SPAD content in Dioscorea nipponica. In terms of nitrogen content prediction, a regression model exploiting the SL characteristic has been discovered to be optimal, demonstrating an R2 of 0.850. For phosphorus, a model incorporating the NRI characteristic has yielded an R2 of 0.819, affirming its efficacy. Meanwhile, potassium content prediction has been found to be most precise with a model centered on the Sb characteristic, as evidenced by an achieved R2 of 0.865. This cutting-edge methodology can significantly advance the agricultural sector, particularly in the realm of mechanized agriculture and automation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dioscorea; Image Processing; Machine Learning; Nutrient; Cultivation; Forecasting; Image Processing; Learning Algorithms; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Potassium; Regression Analysis; Sustainable Development; Dioscorea; Environmental Sustainability; Images Processing; Machine-learning; Mineral Nutrients; Nutritional Benefits; Protein Contents; Sugar Levels; Yield Growth; Yield Prediction; Machine Learning,Cultivation; Forecasting; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Potassium; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Dioscorea; Environmental sustainability; Images processing; Machine-learning; Mineral nutrients; Nutritional benefits; Protein contents; Sugar levels; Yield growth; Yield prediction; Machine learning,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167730466

However, excess nitrogen fertilization can affect the quality of tomato fruit, making it unattractive to consumers. Consequently, the aim of this study is to develop a method for the early detection of excessive nitrogen fertilizer use in Royal tomato by visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. Spectral reflectance values of tomato leaves were captured at wavelengths between 400 and 1100 nm, collected from several treatments after application of normal nitrogen and on the first, second, and third days after application of excess nitrogen. A new method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with an attention mechanism was proposed to perform the estimation of nitrogen overdose in tomato leaves. To verify the effectiveness of this method, the proposed attention mechanism-based CNN classifier was compared with an alternative CNN having the same architecture without integrating the attention mechanism, and with other CNN models, AlexNet and VGGNet. Experimental results showed that the CNN with an attention mechanism outperformed the alternative CNN, achieving a correct classification rate (CCR) of 97.33% for the treatment, compared with a CCR of 94.94% for the CNN alone.

Nutrient smart city circular economy is currently an understudied intersection of growing city populations of food consumers, nutrient recovery technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), and agriculture. Meanwhile, machine learning has exploded with popularity over the years, with many circular economy literatures examining its usefulness in its predictive qualities to support management, optimisation, and recovery of useful resources from organic waste. This review paper examines advancements in machine learning for macronutrient recovery in city organic waste systems for a circular economy. The use of ML will greatly improve the scalability, transparency, productivity and accuracy of nutrient: recovery technologies, logistics, dissemination, and reuse. ML can also be combined with hardware to automate tedious waste separation, recovery and agricultural tasks using drones, hydroponics and satellites. Meanwhile, crop yields, nutrient demand-supply efficiencies, food security, environmental soil monitoring, and prosumer involvement could all increase.

The limited translatability from in vitro lab results into more natural growth conditions in soil remains problematic. Although considerable progress has been made in developing soil-growth assays to tackle this bottleneck, the majority of these assays use pots or whole trays, making them not only space- and resource-intensive, but also hampering the individual treatment of plants. Therefore, we developed a flexible and compact screening system named PhenoWell® in which individual seedlings are grown in wells filled with soil allowing single-plant treatments. The system makes use of an automated image-analysis pipeline that extracts multiple growth parameters from individual seedlings over time, including projected rosette area, relative growth rate, compactness, and stockiness. Macronutrient, hormone, salt, osmotic, and drought stress treatments were tested in the PhenoWell® system. The system is also optimized for maize with results that are consistent with Arabidopsis while different in amplitude. We conclude that the PhenoWell® system enables a high-throughput, precise, and uniform application of a small amount of solution to individually soil-grown plants, which increases the replicability and reduces variability and compound usage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Abiotic Stress; Arabidopsis; Growth And Development; High-throughput Screening Assays; Maize; Nutrients; Phytohormones; Plant Leaves; Seedlings; Soil,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147582698

Bell peppers can be categorized as fruit or vegetable that is universally available and full of various nutrients like carbs, vitamins, and fat. Leaves of bell pepper plants infected by bacterial spot diseases affect their yield significantly. The aim of this study is to classify bacterial spots and healthy images of bell peppers’ leaf images taken from the PlantVillage dataset using CNN-based pre-trained architecture. Two CNN architectures, i.e., VGG16 and VGG19 are applied through transfer learning in the binary classification of leaf-based disease. A total of 2475 images are used for training, validation, and testing purposes, with 1478 healthy images and 997 images with bacterial disease spots.

Because the process-based and statistical approaches to simulating crop yields are different in nature, a comparison between them is needed. This study investigates the accuracy of crop yield simulations in the historical period as well as future projections using two modelling approaches: 1) a process-based approach employing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool+ (SWAT+) model, and 2) a statistical approach employing a data-driven model, Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network (FFBPNN) over a medium-sized catchment in north-western Poland. The application of two potential evapotranspiration methods (Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves) in SWAT+ permitted calibration (2004–2011) and validation (2012–2019) of runoff and yields of winter wheat and spring barley. Different combinations of climatic parameters with a drought index based on Joint Deficit Index were applied to simulate and project rainfed crop yields (winter wheat, barley, potato, rye, rapeseed, sugar beets, cereals, maize for grain, maize for green forage, pulses) with FFBPNN. The results reveal that adding the new drought index helped increase the FFBPNN performance. This approach showed that future yields of the studied crops would slightly increase under RCP8.5 by 2060. Winter wheat and spring barley projections from SWAT+ showed very small changes using both the Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves method. Policy-wise, the results should be of interest to climate change adaptation practitioners and food security experts.

Although some attempts have been made to search for the synergy from co-liquefying various feedstocks, these processes were remarkably time and labor consuming, and often with low rate of success. Therefore, this study for the first time employed machine learning algorithms to mine the synergistic effect in co-HTL. Started with single task prediction, three machine learning algorithms, including Adaboost, Gradient Boosting Regression and Random Forest, were trained and tested for predicting co-HTL biocrude yield and relative co-liquefaction effect (CE). It was found that their prediction performances were favorable over traditional mathematical equations, in which Gradient Boosting Regression exhibited the best performance for co-HTL biocrude yield prediction (training and testing R2 of 0.976 and 0.812 respectively), and Adaboost better estimated relative CE. Feature importance analysis further revealed that co-HTL biocrude yield was mainly influenced by the reaction temperature, but relative CE was closely related to mixed feedstock's lipid and carbohydrate content, implying that the synergism/antagonism from co-HTL was more dependent on the biochemical composition of mixed feedstock than reaction conditions. Multitask predictions, estimating biocrude yield and relative CE simultaneously that are usually required in real co-HTL practices, suggested Adaboost was the most satisfying algorithm (training R2 of 0.922) among studied ones. An optimal relative CE of 22.07 % along with 36.31 wt% (daf) biocrude yield could be obtained when the mixed feedstock contained 42.93 % protein, 50.49 % carbohydrate, 6.58 % lipid at a temperature of 320 °C, which were in well agreement with experimental results from co-HTL of biomass model components. A mini application software (exe. file including machine learning algorithm) was also developed for quick estimation of synergy and co-HTL biocrude yield by simply inputting mixed feedstock's biochemical composition and reaction conditions, showing promising potential for academic and industrial practices to mine the co-HTL synergy and design processes efficiently. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Application Software; Biocrude Yield; Hydrothermal Co-liquefaction; Machine Learning Algorithm; Synergy; Adaptive Boosting; Carbohydrates; Decision Trees; Feedstocks; Forecasting; Industrial Research; Liquefaction; Machine Learning; Applications Software; Biochemical Composition; Biocrude Yield; Co-liquefaction; Hydrothermal Co-liquefaction; Liquefaction Effects; Machine Learning Algorithms; Reaction Conditions; Synergistic Effect; Synergy; Application Programs,Adaptive boosting; Carbohydrates; Decision trees; Feedstocks; Forecasting; Industrial research; Liquefaction; Machine learning; Applications software; Biochemical composition; Biocrude yield; Co-liquefaction; Hydrothermal co-liquefaction; Liquefaction effects; Machine learning algorithms; Reaction conditions; Synergistic effect; Synergy; Application programs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141951954

At present, it is difficult to diagnose rice fungal diseases at an early stage using relevant technologies, and there are a lack of rapid detection methods. This study proposes a microfluidic chip-based method combined with microscopic hyperspectral detection of rice fungal disease spores. First, a microfluidic chip with a dual inlet and three-stage structure was designed to separate and enrich Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores in air. Then, the microscopic hyperspectral instrument was used to collect the hyperspectral data of the fungal disease spores in the enrichment area, and the competitive adaptive reweighting algorithm (CARS) was used to screen the characteristic bands of the spectral data collected from the spores of the two fungal diseases. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to build the full-band classification model and the CARS filtered characteristic wavelength classification model, respectively. The results showed that the actual enrichment efficiency of the microfluidic chip designed in this study on Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores was 82.67% and 80.70%, respectively. In the established model, the CARS-CNN classification model is the best for the classification of Magnaporthe grisea spores and Ustilaginoidea virens spores, and its F1-core index can reach 0.960 and 0.949, respectively.

Its early detection is crucial for suppressing disease spread. Necrotic lesions are normally seen in leaves at 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) when colonized cells are dead, but early detection of the initial biotrophic growth stage, when the pathogen feeds on living cells, is challenging. Here, the biotrophic growth phase of P. infestans was detected by whole-plant redox imaging of potato plants expressing chloroplast-targeted reduction–oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (chl-roGFP2). Clear spots on potato leaves with a lower chl-roGFP2 oxidation state were detected as early as 2 dpi, before any visual symptoms were recorded. These spots were particularly evident during light-to-dark transitions, and reflected the mislocalization of chl-roGFP2 outside the chloroplasts. Image analysis based on machine learning enabled systematic identification and quantification of spots, and unbiased classification of infected and uninfected leaves in inoculated plants. Comparing redox with chlorophyll fluorescence imaging showed that infected leaf areas that exhibit mislocalized chl-roGFP2 also showed reduced non-photochemical quenching and enhanced quantum PSII yield (ΦPSII) compared with the surrounding leaf areas. The data suggest that mislocalization of chloroplast-targeted proteins is an efficient marker of late blight infection, and demonstrate how it can be utilized for non-destructive monitoring of the disease biotrophic stage using whole-plant redox imaging. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Chloroplast; Late Blight; Phytophthora Infestans; Potato; Redox Imaging; Rogfp2; Technical Advance; Plants (botany); Proteins; Cell/b.e; Chloroplast; Late Blight; Phytophthora Infestans; Post Inoculation; Potato; Redox Imaging; Rogfp2; Technical Advances; Whole Plants; Fluorescence Imaging; Cells; Classification; Detection; Growth; Inoculation; Leaves; Plants; Plant Disease; Potato; Plant Diseases; Solanum Tuberosum,Plants (botany); Proteins; Cell/B.E; Chloroplast; Late blight; Phytophthora infestans; Post inoculation; Potato; Redox imaging; Rogfp2; Technical advances; Whole plants; Fluorescence imaging; Cells; Classification; Detection; Growth; Inoculation; Leaves; Plants; plant disease; potato; Plant Diseases; Solanum tuberosum,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147225654

A machine vision system was developed using stereo cameras synchronised to a custom-built LED strobe to perform on-tree sizing of fruit in images with high measurement accuracy. Two deep neural network models (Faster R–CNN and Mask R–CNN) were trained to detect fruit candidates for sizing followed by extrapolation of occluded fruit regions to improve size estimation. The segmented fruit shapes were converted to metric surface areas and diameters using spatial resolutions and depth information from the stereo cameras. Monthly field trials from June to October using the camera system were conducted, measuring fruit diameters ranging from 22 to 82 mm, and compared against ground truth diameters. Diameter estimates had a mean absolute error ranging from 1.1 to 4.2 mm for the five-month trial period, an average error of 4.8% compared to ground truth diameter measurements. Standard deviation errors ranged from 0.7 to 1.9 mm.

Lodging also impedes intercultural management and harvest operations. Currently, no approaches known exist to non-invasively assess sugarcane lodging. This study is therefore focused on expedited and autonomous sugarcane lodging detection using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. A total 1600 digital red-green-blue (RGB) images of lodged and non-lodged sugarcane were acquired for two cultivars and two years (2020, and 2021) of growing seasons. These images were augmented to obtain a total of 6400 images. Based on tested proportions for minimum model overfittings, 80 % of the 6400 images were used for training, 10 % for validation, and remaining 10 % for testing of seven state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models; ResNet50, GoogLeNet, DarkNet53, Inception V3, Xception, AlexNet, and MobileNetV2. When validated, amongst all, ResNet50 demonstrated the highest lodging prediction accuracy of 98.5 %, followed by GoogLeNet (98.0 %), DarkNet53 (97.6 %), InceptionV3 (97.6 %), Xception (97.1 %), AlexNet (96.5 %), and MobileNetV2 (93.6 %) and respective model precisions of 98.6 %, 98.6 %, 97.5 %, 97.2 %, 96.9 %, 96.1 %, and 93.1 %. Maximum accuracies and minimum model overfitting were observed for batch size of 16 and 30 epochs for all the models. The overall error rate for MobileNetV2, AlexNet, Xception, DarkNet53, InceptionV3, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50 models were 6.4 %, 3.5 %, 2.9 %, 2.4 %, 2.4 %, 2.0 % and 1.5 %, respectively. Best performing ResNet50 model was again tested on 50 independent images from real field conditions from both years and a net accuracy of 94 % was obtained. The residual blocks and skip connection features of ResNet50 help optimizing training parameters and therefore achieved better performance compared to other DL models.

The principal receptor of HA in the human body is the Cluster of Differentiation 44 (CD44). To enhance the binding between HA and CD44, a new approach was designed to take advantage of the four-component Ugi reaction. By modifying the carboxyl group on HA with various amine, aldehyde, and isocyanide moieties through the Ugi reaction, 36 HA like polysaccharides were generated. Two lead compounds were identified with enhanced CD44 binding compared to unmodified HA, which was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), cellular studies and an in vivo mouse tumor model. Ski-learn as a machine learning tool was applied to analyze library data and yield predictions with an accuracy over 80 %.

With the advent of digitalization, technology has permeated every aspect of our lives, including agriculture. The potato, a versatile tuber, is a widely enjoyed and commonly consumed staple in diets across the globe. To ensure a prosperous potato production, establishing a robust food security system becomes imperative, given its high nutritional value in terms of vitamins and minerals. Nonetheless, it is crucial to address diseases affecting potatoes including early blight and late blight. The manual assessment of these leaf diseases is labor-intensive and inconvenient. In the present investigation, we have implemented a system that utilizes a combination of machine learning and deep learning methodologies to classify two distinct types of diseases in potato plants, relying on the assessment of their leaf conditions. We utilized a range of models including support vector machine, naive bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, convolutional neural network, Sequential2, and VGG 16 to establish a highly accurate classification system. Notably, our experiment yielded an impressive accuracy of 95.36% within the initial 10 epochs of VGG 16 training, affirming the viability of the deep neural network approach.

The traditional approach of detecting leaf diseases in fruit plants requires farmers to undertake manual inspection which exhibits a lack of reliability and consistency. Moreover, the manual inspection procedure is prone to errors due to its reliance on the farmer's knowledge and skill. Mango referred to as the ""king of all fruits"", is renowned for its rich composition of various vitamins and vital nutrients. Mangoes are susceptible to many diseases that adversely damage their visual appeal, and flavor, and have significant implications on the overall economy. The identification of diseases affecting mango plant leaves using automated recognition remains a challenge due to the diverse range of symptoms and limited availability of data. There have been several deep learning-based research studies focused on identifying diseases in mango leaves; however, the majority of these studies have employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a small number of data. This study presents a Vision Transformer (ViT) based approach to detect diseases in mango leaves using publicly available data namely MangoLeafBD. The ViT model has been selected as the detection model due to its parameter efficiency compared to deep CNN models. The ViT has produced remarkable overall classification accuracy of 100%, precision of 100%, recall of 100%, and f1-score of 100% for disease detection on mango leaves which is better than the existing CNN approaches on the MangoLeafBD dataset. This demonstrates that our approach has the potential to assist farmers in the field by providing automated, simple, and more reliable mango leaf disease diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Image Classification; Mango Leaf Disease; Vision Transformer (vit); Classification (of Information); Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Image Classification; Plants (botany); Convolutional Neural Network; Fresh Food; Fruit Crops; Images Classification; Leaf Disease; Mango Leaf Disease; Manual Inspection; Plant Disease; Vision Transformer; Fruits,Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image classification; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Fresh food; Fruit crops; Images classification; Leaf disease; Mango leaf disease; Manual inspection; Plant disease; Vision transformer; Fruits,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187357014

Automated disease identification is crucial for Tomato leaf protection and reduced crop loss. Unfortunately, no one method of categorizing leaf diseases in tomatoes has proven to be consistently accurate enough for widespread usage. The present study offers a streamlined federated deep learning framework to classify tomato leaf diseases while ensuring the preservation of sensitive data. This framework safeguards client information with a decentralized client-server architecture and verifies federated deep learning models with IID. The researchers piloted the framework with a single and several clients in both conventional and federated learning environments.

A large array of different sensors is deployed using various platforms such as uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. In this context, while multiple concepts of scale exist, the influence of spatial scale plays a major role when comparing and validating optical data derived from either of these platforms. Until to date, no satisfying method to allow cross sensor and scale studies exists. The presented work proposes a custom U-Net architecture to convert multispectral UAV imagery to multispectral satellite imagery. U-Nets are convolutional networks that have shown to be capable of learning mapping patterns between an input image and an output image. Therefore, artificially created images resembles original images at a high level of local detail and global semantic coherence. By using a multi-year, multispectral image UAV dataset, capturing a biologically and structural complex pathosystem (Cercosopora beticola + Beta vulgaris L.), it is shown that the developed custom U-Net can convert original UAV images with low structural and spectral error (MSE of 0.0001, SSIM test score of 0.0003, DWT test score of 0.0104, and a PSNR value of 40.3551) into artificial satellite images. Also, it is compared whether band center and bandwidth are accurately converted. To showcase an application, artificial images have been used to classify levels of Cercospora Leaf Spot in sugar beet. Classification accuracies are similar to those derived from the classification using original images. Therefore, it can be concluded that image to image translation using U-Nets can be a powerful tool for scaling studies in remote sensing. But they also offer to address the issue of data sparsity in machine learning as the conversion allows to generate images across different scales, therefore potentially adding valuable data to time-series studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Drones; Multispectral; Plant Pathology; Scale; Agricultural Robots; Antennas; Deep Learning; Optical Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Semantics; Sugar Beets; Cercospora; Image Translation; Leaf Spots; Multi-spectral; Original Images; Plant Pathology; Remote-sensing; Scale; Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles; Drones,Agricultural robots; Antennas; Deep learning; Optical remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Semantics; Sugar beets; Cercospora; Image translation; Leaf spots; Multi-spectral; Original images; Plant pathology; Remote-sensing; Scale; Uncrewed aerial vehicles; Drones,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186491398

Utilizing data from the Bureau of National Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan (2000-2023), the research develops two ANN models using the Neural Net Fitting library in MATLAB. The first model predicts the total gross yield of main agricultural crops, while the second forecasts the share of individual crops, including cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, vegetables, melons, and sugar beets. The models demonstrate high accuracy, with the total gross yield model achieving an R-squared value of 0.98 and the individual crop model showing an R value of 0.99375. These results indicate a strong predictive capability, essential for practical agricultural and economic planning.

Cotton crops play a vital role in India. Every year, due to the attack of diseases, cotton production is decreasing. The main reasons for disease in plants are the pests, insects, and pathogens used; if they are not controlled on time, they affect productivity. In advancing digital image processing technologies, machine learning and other techniques that identify early disease detection in plants are proposed. This paper focuses on improving disease detection in cotton crop plants and leaves. Machine learning is used to identify and predict cotton plant disease using images and leaves collected in an uncontrolled environment. This study uses machine learning to review the different problems identified regarding plant disease. Various experimental configurations are investigated to analyze the impacts of different leaf classes, plant disease combinations, and their categories. Cotton crops are detected to classify the various types of cotton plants.

As a source of carbohydrates and essential nutrients, potatoes play a crucial role in the global food supply. However, potato farmers often face challenges, namely potato leaf disease, which can damage crop yields and plant quality. Detection of potato leaf disease is essential, but this is a complex matter due to several factors, including varying disease symptoms, varying levels of infection, and environmental factors that can influence disease development. Due to this, the research considers an objective approach for potato leaf disease detection using deep learning technology, especially MobileNet. The flow of this research includes data collection, data pre-processing, model building, model training and testing, and model evaluation. The model will be designed for efficiency in image processing with transfer learning and fine-tuning. Experiments were carried out by trying variations of optimization algorithms, types of surgery, and dropout rates to measure the accuracy of disease detection.

This study investigates a potential of ensemble machine-learning methods in geospatial prediction of soil Fe in Croatia. Using a dataset of 686 soil samples, three individual machine-learning methods, including the extreme gradient boosting (XGB), support vector machine (SVM), and Cubist, as well as their ensemble, were evaluated for the soil Fe prediction. The ensemble method outperformed the individual models, exhibiting a higher prediction accuracy expressed by the coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.578), with a lower root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.837) and the mean absolute error (MAE = 0.550). The soil clay content emerged as the most influential predictor, followed by the sand content, pH values, and select bioclimatic variables. This study’s results demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble machine learning in an accurate prediction of soil Fe content and contribute to an informed decision-making in sustainable agricultural land-use planning and management. By including the complementary machine-learning methods into an ensemble with the representative environmental covariates, a geospatial prediction aids to a reliable comprehension of soil properties and their spatial variability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cubist; Extreme Gradient Boosting; Land-use Planning; Soil Samples; Support Vector Machine,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180210287

In view of this, remote sensing can provide a low-cost avenue to systematically monitor and detect phenological phases from space. The most common approach for retrieving vegetation phenology from remotely sensed time series is the dynamic threshold method. However, only a few number of studies have attempted to calibrate and optimize these derived phenological metrics to relate them to actual crop growth stages. Accordingly, this study attempted to develop a framework to optimize the derivation of phenological phases for three major crops (winter wheat, corn and sugar beet) in Germany by investigating the optimal thresholds and comparing the performances with ground-truth observation data. To this end, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series covering Germany and for two cropping seasons 2019 and 2020 were obtained and derived from a 10 x 10 km tiling grid of Sentinel-2 analysis ready data using a specific decentralized cloud platform that combines both a set of satellite imagery (petabytes of data) with huge analysis capabilities on a very large scale. Since cloud contamination is typically the major drawback for estimating phenology with optical satellite data, the study suggests first a new smoothing and gap filling method (UE-Whittaker) that is based on both envelope detection and the Whittaker filter and that, in the end, constructs high-quality NDVI time series that are suitable for phenological analysis. Based on these generated time series, the estimation of various phenological phases of crops as well as threshold optimisation and calibration were carried out as a second step. In which we traverse the thresholds from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0.01 for each specific phase and finds the optimal threshold when the lowest error value is obtained between the satellite-derived DOY and the observed DOY in ground data from the year 2019. Later on, these optimum thresholds were used to derive phenological phases from the next year, and the results of the calculation of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) between the ground reported in-situ phenology observations and those derived from satellite data reveal that they ranged typically between 3 days and 2 weeks for nearly all the phenological phases. The findings demonstrate how calibrating and optimising the derivation of different phenological phases of crops using only optical data could produce a timely and accurate information on crop growth and its condition for a large area which can be used in agricultural management, crop yield estimation, and several other related applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agriculture; Crop Monitoring; Crop Phenology; Ndvi; Sentinel-2; Smoothing; Time Series Reconstruction; Errors; Image Analysis; Image Reconstruction; Mean Square Error; Optical Remote Sensing; Quality Control; Satellite Imagery; Sugar Beets; Time Series; Time Series Analysis; Vegetation Mapping; Crop Growth; Crop Monitoring; Crop Phenology; Ground Data; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Optimal Threshold; Sentinel-2; Smoothing; Time Series Reconstruction; Times Series; Crops,Errors; Image analysis; Image reconstruction; Mean square error; Optical remote sensing; Quality control; Satellite imagery; Sugar beets; Time series; Time series analysis; Vegetation mapping; Crop growth; Crop monitoring; Crop phenology; Ground data; Normalized difference vegetation index; Optimal threshold; Sentinel-2; Smoothing; Time series reconstruction; Times series; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85177807867

There are several factors which is responsible to control the agricultural product yield. Among them Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium are the macronutrients are the vital elements of the soil . Due to the instability in the climatic condition of India and also due to other biotic and abiotic factors macronutrients get varies. To increase the crop yield, the perfect handling of macronutrients i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are required.

For example, more efficient fertilizer delivery mechanisms can be developed targeting specific tissues such as driving the NMs and their cargo only to the plant rhizosphere and by controlling the rate of release of the agrichemical over longer durations in a controlled manner via stimulus-responsive distribution, or improving the efficiency of nutrient utilization (nutrient-use efficiency). Similarly, agrochemicals used to protect crops against pathogens can be substituted by nano-pesticides which can target pests more effectively with fewer pesticides, minimizing widespread effects on soil health and biodiversity while also increasing soil function and nutrient cycling by boosting the soil microbiota. Plant resilience to extreme environmental conditions can be also enhanced through nano-biotechnology applications giving plants improved functionalities that will help them cope with environmental stress due to climate change. Finally, future nano-agriculture uses include the creation of smart plant sensors, in which the plant itself is tuned to monitor soil/water quality, detect biotic/abiotic stresses, and translate the plant chemical signal into a digital signal that can then be utilized to control NM delivery to the system.

It is also used for producing animal feed, biodiesel, crayons, bio-composites, carpets, candles, cleaners, ink, tires, foam, and way more. However, from sowing to harvesting soybean, several difficulties emerge among which weed removal is most challenging. To assist agriculturalists, several technologies have evolved. Robotic weeding is one such technology that eradicates the growth of weeds without human intervention thereby multiplying the crop yield. This paper focuses on building the best soybean crop and broadleaf weed classifier that helps robots in weed identification and removal by differentiating crops from weeds. Using transfer learning, 16 different CNN-based architectures were built and compared to determine the best classifier. 2382 observations (images) were used to build these classifiers. To expand this crop-weed dataset, six augmentation methods were applied to the training images. 24 metric values were computed for every classifier for comprehensive result analysis. Top-3 metrics were selected and analyzed for finding the best classifier. Ultimately, MobileNet outperforms all other classifiers by resulting in 99.58% model accuracy.

These abiotic stresses are responsible for reducing plant growth and development and ultimately yield. However, plant scientists find a number of mechanism and strategies to minimize the impact of these stresses. Among them, the omics study is relevant to gather all the relevant information regarding the expression of genes, metabolite, protein, transcripts, and ions. Metabolomics is important to study the expression of different enzymes, antioxidants, primary and secondary metabolites, and osmoprotectants under normal and stress environment. This information is used to find the strategy and mechanism to reduce the impact of stresses. This chapter compiles the cereal metabolomics (rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, and barley) and the stress-tolerance mechanism. Improving crop yield and human nutrition shall benefit from a better understanding of plant metabolomic activity. Advances in metabolomics of cereal crops have been the subject of research interest for enhancing their economic and nutritional value. In future, metabolomics may advance further by developing accurate algorithms and using artificial intelligence-based metabolite detection. These will help interpreting high-throughput metabolite data and fitting it into the validated metabolic pathways. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174126268

Given the need to meet the food demand due to population growth, systems capable of optimizing crop yield are currently required. This work contributes with a practical tool that aids farmers in recognizing fruit quality, which is aimed at improving the apple quantification process and harvestability monitoring based on object identification employing computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms. The development of the system presents i) detection of the apple classes for product counting and ii) quality classification for inspection and validation of the fruit by category. For grading of apple types, the SSD-MobileNet detection network model was used. A fast convolutional neural network FCN-ResNet 18 was used to segment quality instances at the pixel level. The proposed system was trained, validated, and tested on several experimental laboratory and field scenarios using two image databases generated in controlled and real agricultural environments. Results show that it is possible to detect and classify the quality status of apples during harvest, obtaining an accuracy ranging between 86.7% and 92.6% for detection and 94.7 ± 2.5% for segmentation, exceeding the results presented in related works in both cases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Apple Grading; Computer Vision; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Instance Segmentation,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173928787

The progress of farming as a whole has been greatly influenced by advancements in plant physiology. Use of organic and mineral fertilizers has been rationalized. A scientific rationale for the necessity of irrigation has been developed via studies of the soil and plant water requirements. When the right conditions, such as the right temperature, humidity, sunlight, moisture, nutrients, etc. were present, these developments led to an increase in the soil's effective fertility, which in turn contributed to boost crop output. Crops are chosen based on the quality of the soil and the climate. The suggested agro method helps farmers identify the type of soil with the aid of sensors that can measure the soil's moisture content, pH level, and nutrient content (NPK). The farmer will be able to choose the right crops to plant with the aid of these values. Crop selection should be based on a number of parameters, including the kind of soil, its texture, and its nutrient content. The major goal is to increase plant health while simultaneously lowering excessive water use. It must guarantee that the crops are not over-or under-irrigated. Building a water supply system that will consider the soil's moisture content and disperse water as the soil requires can solve this issue, without harming the crop and without using excessive amounts of water. We can continuously check the amount of water in the soil by utilising inexpensive sensors. When the water level drops and crosses a certain threshold, the sensors will trigger a sprinkler or a pump that is connected to it, providing water to the crops. This arrangement will assist small-scale farmers in increasing crop yields, which will boost the Indian economy. The IoT module has sensors for soil moisture, temperature, pH, and NPK that collect data in real time and upload it to a cloud storage. Then, pre-trained models created using machine learning methods will be compared with the real-time sensed data. The Sensor Information Unit, which is connected to the secure cloud storage, receives data from the deployed sensors. A machine learning algorithm will be utilised to anticipate the appropriate crops that can be produced in that particular soil utilising the data obtained by the cloud for data analysis. The machine learning module will additionally predict when fertilisers will need to be applied and how precise monitoring will result in a high crop yield. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Technology; Cultivation; Digital Storage; Economics; Farms; Fertilizers; Internet Of Things; Investments; Learning Algorithms; Moisture Determination; Soil Moisture; Textures; Water Levels; Water Supply; Climatic Conditions; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Mineral Fertilizers; Nutrient Contents; Organic Fertilizers; Plant Physiology; Real- Time; Soil Conditions; Soil Moisture Content; Crops,Agricultural technology; Cultivation; Digital storage; Economics; Farms; Fertilizers; Internet of things; Investments; Learning algorithms; Moisture determination; Soil moisture; Textures; Water levels; Water supply; Climatic conditions; Crop production; Crop yield; Mineral fertilizers; Nutrient contents; Organic fertilizers; Plant physiology; Real- time; Soil conditions; Soil moisture content; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173867329

Irrigation, as a hydrological artificial process, has an indispensable role in achieving that goal. However, high pressure and demand on water resources could lead to serious problems in water consumption. Knowing information about the spatial distribution of irrigation parcels is essential to many aspects of Earth system science and global change research. To extract this knowledge for the main agricultural region in Serbia located in the moderate continental area, we utilized optical satellite Sentinel-2 data and collected ground truth data needed to train the machine learning model. Both satellite imagery and ground truth data were collected for the three most irrigated crops, maize, soybean, and sugar beet during 3 years (2020–2022) characterized by different weather conditions. This data was then used for training the Random Forest-based models, separately for each crop type, differentiating irrigated and rainfed crops on the parcel level. Finally, the models were run for the whole territory of Vojvodina generating 10 m resolution maps of irrigated three crops of interest. With overall accuracy for crops per year (2020: 0.76; 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.84) results showed that this method could be successfully used for detecting the irrigation of three crops of interest. This was confirmed by validation with the national dataset from Public Water Management Company “Vode Vojvodine” which revealed that classification maps had an accuracy of 76%. These maps further allow us to understand the spatial dynamics of the most important irrigated crops and can serve for the improvement of sustainable agricultural water management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Irrigation; Random Forest; Sentinel-2; Water Management; Agricultural Application; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Consumption Behavior; Detection Method; Irrigation; Machine Learning; Population Growth; Satellite Data; Sentinel; Spatial Distribution; Water Management; Water Use; Serbia; Vojvodina,agricultural application; climate change; climate effect; consumption behavior; detection method; irrigation; machine learning; population growth; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial distribution; water management; water use; Serbia; Vojvodina,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173456572

They developed a wide variety of molecular mechanisms to react to a complex network of environmental signals, multiple pathways activated by various responsive genes, abiotic stresses, and diseases brought on by bacteria, fungus, nematodes, and viruses that affect plant growth and crop yield. The molecular foundation of plant responses has thus been the subject of substantial research. The advancing omics technologies offer vital tactics for fostering molecular research and cutting-edge methods for omics-assisted crop improvement. Bioinformatics has aided in genome sequencing of various plant species, gene identification, phylogenetic profiling of plant species, detection of transcription factor binding sites of the genes, and the discovery of different sites where protein interactions can take place. To help to understand biology at the system level, bioinformatics begins to show promise in unravelling genetic networks. Plant life plays important and diverse roles in our society, our economy, and our global environment. Feeding the increasing world population is a challenge for the modern plant biotechnology. Crop yields have increased during the last century and will continue to improve by novel strategies and technologies. The transition from expressed sequence tags and microarray-based techniques to more potent strategies like RNA sequencing and related technologies has been encouraged by the next-generation sequencing, which has largely favoured deeper insights in plant genome organizations and on-functional responses to variable environmental parameters. Simultaneously, the development in the proteomics techniques that is 2D gel coupled to mass spectrometry, of high-throughput shotgun approaches, and of more robust LC-MS and GC-MS and metabonomic technologies are able to unravel fluctuations of non-volatiles and volatiles, paving the way to a better understanding of the effects of plant biological processes and investigations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agrigenomics; Artificial Intelligence; Dna Microarray; Pathogen Detection; Persistent Plant Pathogens; Surveillance,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173357978

However, the increase in production levels has led to an increase in the number of diseases that affect the crop. One of the most devastating diseases is sugarcane red rot (SRR) disease. A multi-layer perceptron (MP) based deep learning (DL) model was built for the identification and classification of SRR illness using a dataset of 20,000 photos of sugarcane leaves in order to address this problem. This model was trained on 20,000 photographs of sugarcane leaves. The dataset was classified into 5 different disease severity levels. The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.97% for binary classification and an accuracy rate of 98.03% for overall multi-classification.

So this paper mainly focuses on apple leaf disease detection problem, proposes a machine vision algorithm model for fast apple leaf disease detection called LALNet (High-speed apple leaf network). First, an efficient sacked module for apple leaf detection, known as EALD (efficient apple leaf detection stacking module), was designed by utilizing the multi-branch structure and depth-separable modules. In the backbone network of LALNet, (High-speed apple leaf network) four layers of EALD modules were superimposed and an SE(Squeeze-and-Excitation) module was added in the last layer of the model to improve the attention of the model to important features. A structural reparameterization technique was used to combine the outputs of two layers of deeply separable convolutions in branch during the inference phase to improve the model’s operational speed.

India has always been the largest manufacturing country, dominated by agriculture. Cereals, fruits, and vegetables such as potatoes, oranges, tomatoes, sugar cane, other cereals, and cotton are the most important crops in India. Maharashtra's impressive economic growth is partly based on its diverse citrus and cotton industries. This situation has created jobs for many people and great potential for economic growth in the state. The government focused on disease control, labor costs, and global markets to keep the citrus and cotton industries thriving. Recently, citrus canker, lime green, and black spotted cotton have seriously threatened citrus trees in Maharashtra. These diseases cause tree dieback and death, reduced yields, and loss of marketability. Likewise, farmers worry about the cost of tree loss, exploration, and chemicals used to control the disease. Automated detection systems can help prevent and reduce significant losses to industry, farmers, and the country's economy. This study aims to detect these diseases in crops using pattern recognition methods. The recognition method comprises three main subsystems: image acquisition, processing, and pattern recognition. The images are pre-processed to eliminate any unwanted noise, then the sheets' boundaries are identified, and finally, any relevant features are extracted. Different culture conditions were utilized using pattern recognition techniques to categorize the samples. To evaluate the classification method, we compared the results of different classification methods for detecting diseases in fruits, vegetables, and cereals, achieving an accuracy of 90–95%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cnn Architectures; Deep Learning; Plant Diseases; Costs; Cotton; Deep Learning; Disease Control; Fruits; International Trade; Lime; Sugar Cane; Vegetables; Wages; Agricultural Economy; Classification Methods; Cnn Architecture; Economic Growths; Food Industries; Phase Detection; Phase Identification; Plant Disease; State Of The Art; Crops,Costs; Cotton; Deep learning; Disease control; Fruits; International trade; Lime; Sugar cane; Vegetables; Wages; Agricultural economy; Classification methods; CNN architecture; Economic growths; Food industries; Phase detection; Phase identification; Plant disease; State of the art; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172735917

This paper aims to predict and recognize the nutrient deficiency occurring in tomato plants’ flowering and fruiting stages by using two deep learning models, Yolov7 and ResNet50. The study focuses on predicting and classifying tomato plants’ malnutrition stage with an essential mineral nutrient, calcium (Ca2+). ResNet50 and Yolov7 are used to classify three stages of calcium deficiency in tomato fruits by analyzing the captured images of the development of tomato plants under greenhouse conditions. The dataset includes a total of 189 captured images that cover the different levels of calcium deficiency in tomato fruits.

However, the crop is vulnerable to many diseases. Research has revealed that image recognition using machine learning and deep learning techniques can be applied in automatic identification of cassava leaf diseases. Therefore this study focuses on using strongly discriminative features of the leaf regions affected by disease and weakening regions of low interest to improve the classification accuracy. A convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is a common attention mechanism integrated in feed-forward convolutional neural networks. In this study, CBAM is added to the pretrained ResNet50 and VGG19 models to recognize the cassava leaf regions affected by disease. This is done by sequentially inferring attention maps along two dimensions, channel and spatial for every intermediate feature map. The attention maps are then multiplied to the input feature map for adaptive feature refinement. The performance of baseline models such as EfficientNet, ResNet50, Inceptionv3, and Xception is compared with the attention-based models trained, validated and tested on a public dataset from Makerere University AI laboratory. ResNet50+CBAM achieve the highest performance with accuracy of 97%, precision of 96%, recall of 94% and F-measure of 95%. Conclusively, attention-based models perform better than the baseline models with a performance improvement of over 1%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attention Mechanism; Cassava Leaf Disease; Classification; Feature Fusion; Transfer Learning; Automation; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Feedforward Neural Networks; Image Recognition; Learning Systems; Plants (botany); Transfer Learning; Attention Mechanisms; Baseline Models; Cassavum Leaf Disease; Disease Classification; Feature Map; Features Fusions; Food Crops; Leaf Disease; Performance; Deep Learning,Automation; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Feedforward neural networks; Image recognition; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Transfer learning; Attention mechanisms; Baseline models; Cassavum leaf disease; Disease classification; Feature map; Features fusions; Food crops; Leaf disease; Performance; Deep learning,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169611078

More over 60% of the world’s population relies mostly on agricultural sources for food, according to linked statistics. Plant infections, however, are a catastrophic issue that seriously hampers agriculture productivity. Plant diseases cause a loss of agriculture productivity of about 25% per year. Potato crops have many benefits for human life. One of the most valuable benefits of potatoes for humans is their carbohydrate content; carbohydrates are the leading food for humans. The development of potato crop agriculture is significant for the sustainability of human life. There are several obstacles to developing potato farming, including a disease that attacks potato leaves. Infestans only the diseases early Blight (Alternia Solani) and late Blight (Phytophthora infestans de Bary) are among the most harmful to potato crops. However, the percentage of crops that fail to grow grows due to the erroneous and tardy identification of plant diseases. Using a diagnostic and detection system based on the Hybrid CNN (Convolutional neural network) with SVM (Support vector machine) presently deep learning (DL) technology, we offer an efficient and accurate way to identify early plant illnesses to reduce the plant output losses. Potato leaf disease detection issues can be resolved with the use of informatics technology and digital image processing. From the input photos of the supported training dataset, we utilised CNN to extract best feature of the illness characteristics, and then we used SVM to those features to do classification. 1900 photos of potato leaves were used to train the deep learning model, and about 950 images were utilised for testing. We suggested the CNN model and trained a strong accuracy data set. In addition, we employed ResNET50, a transfer learning model, and obtained accuracy that was superior to our suggested CNN model. It’s interesting that the accuracy of our suggested Hybrid CNN (ResNet 50) with SVN is 97.3% and that it was trained using the same Potato lead picture dataset and test data accuracy is 95.6. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cnn; Deep Learning; Plant Disease Detection; Potato Leaf Image; Resnet50; Svm; Carbohydrates; Classification (of Information); Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Farms; Image Processing; Learning Systems; Neural Network Models; Plants (botany); Population Statistics; Statistical Tests; Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Detection; Human Lives; Leaf Images; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Detection; Potato Leaf Image; Resnet50; Support Vectors Machine; Support Vector Machines,Carbohydrates; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Farms; Image processing; Learning systems; Neural network models; Plants (botany); Population statistics; Statistical tests; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Human lives; Leaf images; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Potato leaf image; Resnet50; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169054587

The majority of individuals in India, whether driven by inherited customs or conscious environmental considerations, choose farming as their primary occupation. The knowledge of cultivating lands or growing crops has been transferred from their ancestors. These farmers who generally stay in the rural part of India don't have any guidance or knowledge that helps their occupation grow healthy crops and achieve greater crop yields. Farmers commonly engage in the repetitive cultivation of crops year after year, following a consistent pattern of crop types and utilizing identical fertilizers. Unfortunately, this practice leads to the depletion of essential nutrients and minerals necessary for cultivating robust and thriving crops. Farmers struggle to find the right disease and often don't know which product is better to grow at which season based on environmental factors. Farmers encounter several challenges and obstacles in their profession. However, accessing information at their fingertips remains the most effective and efficient means for farmers to acquire knowledge in today's digital age. This research focuses on a procedure designed to assist farmers in determining the most suitable crop for their specific location, while also providing them with valuable information regarding crop diseases related and recommendations for appropriate fertilizers. The system incorporates a community section where farmers can post and update crop-related issues, enabling anyone to view and offer suggestions to address the problems. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and predictive analysis, this technology empowers farmers to cultivate thriving crops, receive fertilizer recommendations, and receive assistance in addressing crop diseases.

Due to various plant diseases found in Cassava, security threat is posed in developing countries. To stop spoiling the whole plant, a lot of effort has been made by researchers to identify early leaf disease as agricultural farming is closely associated with every country’s economy. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) models have achieved a lot of success with big data, available resources and improvement in learning algorithms. However, there are invalid instances in big data like ambiguous or mislabelled or irrelevant. Though the performance of ML model is not degraded if such instances are small as the effect of the average gradient is small during the training. But the performance of system is degraded if quantity of invalid instances is large. The existing work for leaf disease detection is performed using Model Centric approach, where hyperparameter tuning is performed to enhance the performance of the system. Recently, focus in changed from Model Centric to Data Centric approach, where model is fixed but quality of dataset is enhanced by considering the consistency of labels, systematic sampling of training data and selection of appropriate batches. This is an invaluable step towards improvement of any system. In this work, noise label detection and correction are performed on Cassava Leaf Disease Classification dataset using confidence learning. The generated quality data is given to the model, and performance comparison is made between model centric and data centric approaches, which concludes that the performance of data centric is improved by 6.33%.

In the future, it won’t be possible to achieve without the application of nitrogen fertilizer. A useful and cutting edge technique for diagnosing the nitrogen nutrition of crops is needed for an effective and appropriate nitrogen fertilizer management system. Plant diseases that have a substantial impact on agricultural output are brought on by nutrient deficiency. Rice producers can reduce output loss significantly by taking essential measures with the help of early disease identification.

We aim to close this gap by proposing technological solutions to automatically detect weeds in soybean plants. Soybeans (Glycine max) are edible seeds from the annual legume in the peas family (Fabaceae). Soybeans are the world’s most important bean crop, providing vegetable protein to millions of people and hundreds of chemical ingredients. Object discovery is a computer-aided operation that involves identifying the class of an object and its location in an image. We have used three popular algorithms for detecting weeds in soybean plantations such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) v3, v4, and v5. YOLOv4 and v5 are trained on publicly available soybean databases to identify and distinguish the presence of weeds on the field.

One issue in the sugar sector is if sugarcane illnesses are not treated and diagnosed early, they can eradicate growing crops that are infected with the disease, costing small-scale farmers money. The continuously growing categories of illnesses and farmers' limited capacity for disease diagnosis and identification served as the impetus for this investigation. Deep learning techniques combined with computer vision and machine learning provide a solution to this problem. In this work, a deep learning model with a 97% accuracy rate was constructed and evaluated using 1200 photos of healthy and sick sugarcane leaves.

Fruits are more susceptible to the disease while they are actively growing. It is possible to safeguard and enhance agricultural productivity by early detection of fruit diseases. A huge farm makes it tough to inspect each tree to learn about its fruit personally. There are several applications for image processing with the Internet of Things (IoT) in various fields. To safeguard the fruit trees from illness and weather conditions, it is difficult for the farmers and their workers to regularly examine these large areas. With the advent of Precision Farming, a new way of thinking about agriculture has emerged, incorporating cutting-edge technological innovations. One of the modern farmers' biggest challenges is detecting fruit diseases in their early stages. If infections aren't identified in time, farmers might see a drop in income. Hence this paper is about an Artificial Intelligence Based Fruit Disease Identification System (AI-FDIS) with a drone system featuring a high-accuracy camera, substantial computing capability, and connectivity for precision farming. As a result, it is possible to monitor large agricultural areas precisely, identify diseased plants, and decide on the chemical to spray and the precise dosage to use. It is connected to a cloud server that receives images and generates information from these images, including crop production projections. The farm base can interface with the system with a user-friendly Human-Robot Interface (HRI). It is possible to handle a vast area of farmland daily using this method.

Early identification and disease diagnosis of fruit crops are essential for the food industry to increase production. The development of the healthy fruit sector is highly dependent on plant diseases. Guava fruit is a good source of fiber, calcium, pectins, and vitamin C. Guava disease has become a major issue for guava production, which has a negative impact on farmers' socioeconomic growth. Infections that harm guava plants and fruits pose the greatest obstacles, although they can be avoided by early identification. Deep learning has recently been widely used to automatically identify a variety of diseases that cannot be seen with the human eye. In this study, convolution neural models are suggested to use leaf images to detect guava disease. The presented models can be used to categorize the main guava leaf diseases, including Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. The kaggle dataset is used to gather images of guava with the disease Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. In our work, CNN models like DenseNet121, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, and Xception are used to categorize the diseases that affect guava leaves. The experimental findings indicate that, with an accuracy of 96.12%, the DenseNet169 model outperformed other models. When the model's effectiveness is assessed using performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, the results demonstrate that DenseNet169 gives excellent results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Guava Leave Disease; Plant Leave Disease; Pretrained Models; Transfer Learning; Convolution; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Economics; Fruits; Learning Systems; Plants (botany); Comparatives Studies; Convolutional Neural Network; Guava Leave Disease; Learning Models; Plant Disease; Plant Leave Disease; Plant Leaves; Pretrained Model; Transfer Learning; Convolutional Neural Networks,Convolution; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Economics; Fruits; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Comparatives studies; Convolutional neural network; Guava leave disease; Learning models; Plant disease; Plant leave disease; Plant leaves; Pretrained model; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural networks,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160447223

Crop yield is influenced by soil pH and macronutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Precision agriculture, which has gained appeal on a global scale, can be achieved in part by managing fertilizers properly in accordance with soil health. The standard laboratory test is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Sample testing takes longer duration due to overworked soil testing labs, which discourages farmers from performing soil fertility tests. To address the aforementioned issue, portable, farmer-friendly, rapid-testing technology is required, and our effort is geared in that direction. Soil samples were treated with reagents that turn the clear solution into color as per soil nutrients. An android phone was used to detect and quantify color information using a built-in camera, computing hardware, graphical user interface, image processing, and machine learning classification techniques. The machine learning model was trained using 410 samples collected under various lighting situations, followed by labeling and validation. On 100 samples, it was examined, and the estimated variance was determined to be between 2–11%.

At first, the leaf image is segmented, and later features such as area, entropy, and aspect ratio are extracted. These features are fed to the KNN classifier to get the desired result. Using this technology, it will have a significant impact on farming. The cost of fertilizers and excessive or wrong use of pesticides can be reduced, and hence, it can lead to an increase in productivity. The accuracy we have achieved is 96%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Disease Detection; Feature Extraction; Image Segmentation; K-nearest Neighbours (knn); Plant Leaves; Aspect Ratio; Farms; Feature Extraction; Image Segmentation; Nearest Neighbor Search; Plants (botany); Viruses; Disease Detection; Features Extraction; Images Processing; Images Segmentations; K-near Neighbor; Machine Learning Models; Nearest-neighbour; Plant Leaves; Primary Producers; Tomato Leaf; Crops,Aspect ratio; Farms; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Nearest neighbor search; Plants (botany); Viruses; Disease detection; Features extraction; Images processing; Images segmentations; K-near neighbor; Machine learning models; Nearest-neighbour; Plant leaves; Primary producers; Tomato leaf; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152540140

However, the diagnosis of diseases in cassava crops is laborious, time-consuming and requires specialised personnel. In addition, very little research is available on images of cassava leaves taken with mobile phones and under field conditions. Therefore, the study designs deep learning models for the detection of diseases in cassava leaves from photos taken with mobile phones in the field. This study used a dataset of 21’397 images of cassava bacterial blight, cassava brown streak disease, cassava green mottle and cassava mosaic disease from a Kaggle competition. Twelve CNN models have been evaluated by applying transfer learning and data augmentation. Each of the models was trained with uniform samples and class-weighted samples. The results showed that the use of weighted samples reduced F1 score and accuracy in all cases. Furthermore, the DenseNet169 model was outstanding with an accuracy and F1 score of 74.77% and 0.59 respectively. Finally, the causes that hinder correct classification have been identified.

In this chapter, we introduce a protocol routinely used in our laboratory to investigate actin dynamics in response to bacterial cues. We describe the bacterial inoculation methods, plant sample preparation, and imaging techniques used to monitor actin responses in different Arabidopsis cell types including epidermal cells from light-grown leaves and dark-grown hypocotyls, as well as guard cells.

Infected plants have an impact on the agricultural production and economic resources of a country. Early detection of plant diseases minimizes the risk of crop loss by allowing farmers to adopt curative and preventative actions to avoid further damage. Citrus is a large plant that is primarily grown in tropical areas of the world because of its high vitamin C and other key nutrient content. Citrus plant diseases play a vital role in causing a great financial loss to the farmers and affect the economy of the country. The tomato ranks among the most economically important vegetable crops, with a global production rate of around 200 million tonnes. But due to diseases occurring in the tomato plants, the farmers are facing a great loss. To prevent these losses and provide an immediate cure, we create a model to detect plant diseases. To get a better performance model, the data augmentation process is used, and we got 18,392 images. In our model, we used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the citrus and tomato leaf diseases. The diseases are Mancha Graxa, Citrus Canker, Tomato Early Blight, Tomato Septoria Leafspot, Tomato Spider Mite Two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), Tomato mosaic virus (Tobamovirus), Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (Begomovirus), Tomato Target Spot (Corynespora cassiicola). Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is stacked by multiple convolutions and pooling layers to detect plant leaf diseases. We train a model with augmented images. After the model gets trained, it is thoroughly tested to ensure that the results are accurate. Thereby we were able to achieve high validation accuracy with a rate of (97.02%) for this dataset used. As the results showed, applying the deep CNN model to identify diseases could greatly impact the accurate identification of diseases, and could even prove useful in detecting diseases in real-time agricultural systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Citrus Disease; Convolutional Neural Network (cnn); Deep Learning; Tomato Diseases; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Damage Detection; Deep Learning; Drought; Fruits; Multilayer Neural Networks; Real Time Systems; Tropics; Viruses; Agricultural Productions; Citrus Disease; Convolutional Neural Network; Economic Resources; Leaf Disease; Plant Disease; Production Resources; Tomato Disease; Losses,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Damage detection; Deep learning; Drought; Fruits; Multilayer neural networks; Real time systems; Tropics; Viruses; Agricultural productions; Citrus disease; Convolutional neural network; Economic resources; Leaf disease; Plant disease; Production resources; Tomato disease; Losses,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147854226

Agricultural activities are carried out in the delta area due to the availability of water resources. In recent years, river water has been polluted in various ways through human activities and the process of industrialization. Consequently, contamination has an impact on the soil health of agricultural land. As a result, our focus has been on soil health analysis by measuring the chemical properties and heavy metals that exist in the soil. A classification model has been developed to determine the contamination level that exists in the soil through interpolation techniques. Soil samples are analysed in terms of soil chemical properties such as macronutrient, micronutrient, pH, and electric conductivity. Samples are collected at different locations at various depths where the sample size is 33. Samples are taken from the different regions that cover the category of farmland, urban areas, industrial areas, and river beds in the Cauvery delta region. A continuous surface had created for the concentration of the chemical constituents that are present in the soil through the space interpolation techniques using GIS technology which was determined from the analytical classification of the amount of the chemicals or the heavy metals that present in the soil has been determined through the fuzzy logic membership function. The soil contamination analysis based on the GIS approach provides an ongoing basis for monitoring contaminated sites. The contamination level along with to which extent it was contaminated is determined. The classification of the overall soil contamination levels of the Cauvery delta region is provided in detail, and its dispersed outcome is represented as a statistical analysis report in the form of the spatial variation maps. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cauvery Delta Region; Fuzzy Logic; Gis; Soil Contamination; Spatial Variation; Agriculture; Computer Circuits; Fuzzy Logic; Geographic Information Systems; Heavy Metals; Indicators (chemical); Interpolation; Membership Functions; Ph; River Pollution; Rivers; Soil Surveys; Water Quality; Agricultural Productivity; Cauvery Delta Region; Contamination Levels; Fuzzy-logic; Interpolation Techniques; Machine-learning; Soil Contamination; Soil Health; Spatial Variations; Tamil Nadu; Soils,Agriculture; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Geographic information systems; Heavy metals; Indicators (chemical); Interpolation; Membership functions; pH; River pollution; Rivers; Soil surveys; Water quality; Agricultural productivity; Cauvery delta region; Contamination levels; Fuzzy-Logic; Interpolation techniques; Machine-learning; Soil contamination; Soil health; Spatial variations; Tamil Nadu; Soils,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144222010

The need of food is also increasing gradually with increase in population. This need of food is satisfied by analyzing soil parameters. Soil parameters are a key factor while calculating the fertility of the soil. Farmers can take large production in the small land with the help of considering the soil parameters. Internet of Things (IoT) has made large contribution in bringing the automation in the field of agriculture. Farmers can check fertility of soil with ease by using IoT. Fertility of the soil is based on various micronutrients and macronutrients. The parameters values of the soil nutrient are taken by using various sensors. Those values are passed on cloud by using ESP8266-12E module. These parameter values are stored on ThingSpeak cloud. Data monitoring can be easily as it can accessible from cloud. These data can be easily analyzed by comparing it with threshold values. The generated data can be processed by using machine learning algorithm.

There is also an urgent need to increase the number of alternative techniques for detecting plant diseases, which is now lacking. The agriculture and agricultural support sectors in India provide employment for the great majority of the country’s people. In India, the agricultural production of the country is directly connected to the country’s economic growth rate. In order to sustain healthy plant development, a variety of processes must be followed, including consideration of environmental factors and water supply management for the optimal production of crops. It is inefficient and uncertain in its outcomes to use the traditional method of watering a lawn. The devastation of more than 18% of the world’s agricultural produce is caused by disease attacks on an annual basis. Because it is difficult to execute these activities manually, identifying plant diseases is essential to decreasing losses in the agricultural product business. In addition to diagnosing a wide range of plant ailments, our method also includes the identification of infections as a prophylactic step. Below is a detailed description of a farm-based module that includes numerous cloud data centers and data conversion devices for accurately monitoring and managing farm information and environmental elements. This procedure involves imaging the plant’s visually obvious signs in order to identify disease. It is recommended that the therapy be used in conjunction with an application to minimize any harm. Increased productivity as a result of the suggested approach would help both the agricultural and irrigation sectors. The plant area module is fitted with a mobile camera that captures images of all of the plants in the area, and all of the plants’ information is saved in a database, which is accessible from any computer with Internet access. It is planned to record information on the plant’s name, the type of illness that has been afflicted, and an image of the plant. In a wide range of applications, bots are used to collect images of various plants as well as to prevent disease transmission. To ensure that all information given is retained on the Internet, data is collected and stored in cloud storage as it becomes essential to regulate the condition. According to our findings from our research on wide images of healthy and ill fruit and plant leaves, real-time diagnosis of plant leaf diseases may be done with 98.78% accuracy in a laboratory environment. We utilized 40,000 photographs and then analyzed 10,000 photos to construct a DCDM deep learning model, which was then used to train additional models on the data set. Using a cloud-based image diagnostic and classification service, consumers may receive information about their condition in less than a second on average, with the process requiring only 0.349 s on average. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Product Sector; Cloud Data Center; Cloud Storage; Deeplens Classification And Detection Model (dcdm); Mobile Camera; Plant Diseases; Agricultural Technology; Cameras; Cloud Storage; Data Handling; Diagnosis; Economics; Fruits; Plants (botany); Water Management; Agricultural Product Sector; Classification Models; Cloud Data Centers; Cloud Storages; Cloud-based; Condition; Deeplens Classification And Detection Model; Detection Models; Mobile Camera; Plant Disease; Water Supply; Unclassified Drug; Accuracy Assessment; Agricultural Application; Crop Production; Detection Method; Disease Control; Disease Incidence; Disease Transmission; Environmental Monitoring; Identification Method; Image Analysis; Image Classification; Information And Communication Technology; Internet; Irrigation System; Real Time; Accuracy; Agricultural Worker; Agriculture; Algorithm; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Ascending Aorta; Cloud Computing; Consumer; Crop; Deep Learning; Deeplens Classification And Detection Model; Diagnostic Accuracy; Economic Development; Employment; Environmental Factor; Food Safety; Fruit; Growth Rate; Image Processing; Image Quality; Image Segmentation; India; Internet Access; Kernel Method; Learning Algorithm; Machine Learning; Mathematical Analysis; Nonhuman; Photography; Plant Development; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Productivity; Protein Secondary Structure; Responsibility; Robotics; Support Vector Machine; Water Supply; Human; Mobile Application; Prevention And Control; Cloud Computing; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Mobile Applications; Plant Diseases,Agricultural technology; Cameras; Cloud storage; Data handling; Diagnosis; Economics; Fruits; Plants (botany); Water management; Agricultural product sector; Classification models; Cloud data centers; Cloud storages; Cloud-based; Condition; Deeplens classification and detection model; Detection models; Mobile camera; Plant disease; Water supply; unclassified drug; accuracy assessment; agricultural application; crop production; detection method; disease control; disease incidence; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; identification method; image analysis; image classification; information and communication technology; Internet; irrigation system; real time; accuracy; agricultural worker; agriculture; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; ascending aorta; cloud computing; consumer; crop; deep learning; deeplens classification and detection model; diagnostic accuracy; economic development; employment; environmental factor; food safety; fruit; growth rate; image processing; image quality; image segmentation; India; internet access; kernel method; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; photography; plant development; plant disease; plant leaf; productivity; protein secondary structure; responsibility; robotics; support vector machine; water supply; human; mobile application; prevention and control; Cloud Computing; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Mobile Applications; Plant Diseases,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140647930

The changes in metabolites, for example chlorophyll or flavonoids, have long been detectable using time-consuming destructive analytical methods including high-performance liquid chromatography or photometric determination. Recent plant phenotyping studies have revealed that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the UV range can be used to link spectral changes with changes in plant metabolites. To compare established destructive analytical methods with new nondestructive hyperspectral measurements, the interaction between sugar beet leaves and the pathogens Cercospora beticola, which causes Cercospora leaf spot disease (CLS), and Uromyces betae, which causes sugar beet rust (BR), was investigated. With the help of destructive analyses, we showed that both diseases have different effects on chlorophylls, carotenoids, flavonoids, and several phenols. Nondestructive hyperspectral measurements in the UV range revealed different effects of CLS and BR on plant metabolites resulting in distinct reflectance patterns. Both diseases resulted in specific spectral changes that allowed differentiation between the two diseases. Machine learning algorithms enabled the differentiation between the symptom classes and recognition of the two sugar beet diseases. Feature importance analysis identified specific wavelengths important to the classification, highlighting the utility of the UV range. The study demonstrates that HSI in the UV range is a promising, nondestructive tool to investigate the influence of plant diseases on plant physiology and biochemistry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",High-performance Liquid Chromatography; Hyperspectral Imaging; Machine Learning; Plant Metabolites; Sugar Beet; Uv Range; Sugars; Carbohydrate; Ascomycetes; Beet; Microbiology; Physiology; Plant Disease; Vegetable; Ascomycota; Beta Vulgaris; Hyperspectral Imaging; Plant Diseases; Sugars; Vegetables,carbohydrate; Ascomycetes; beet; microbiology; physiology; plant disease; vegetable; Ascomycota; Beta vulgaris; Hyperspectral Imaging; Plant Diseases; Sugars; Vegetables,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139643262

This paper presents an assessment of the random forest (RF)-based prediction model and second-degree polynomial regression models for sugarcane yield prediction. The models are developed utilizing vegetation indices (VIs) computed from the Sentinel-2 satellite and sugarcane yield data. The sugarcane yield data were acquired from sugarcane fields around the Godavari Bio-refineries Limited (GBL) factory in Karnataka, India, during the 2017-2018 sugarcane growing season. A dataset detailing agronomic information and VIs was prepared for yield prediction. The study area comprises seven sugarcane growing talukas. The second-degree polynomial regression was used for predicting the sugarcane yield as it had the best fit for the distribution of variables. The green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) recorded the highest R2, i.e., 0.71 during November month with a coefficient of variance of 0.83, with all other indices characterized by R2 values ranging from 0.42(modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index) to 0.69 (normalized difference red edge), suggesting the GNDVI's potential for sugarcane yield prediction. Comparing the actual yield with the predicted yield, the RF prediction and second-degree polynomial regression model exhibited accuracies of 90.42% and 88%, respectively. This indicates that the models are sufficiently accurate and beneficial in decision-making for sugar mill operational planning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Polynomial Regression; Random Forest; Remote Sensing; Sugarcane; Vegetation Indices,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144894355

The UN also recognized this need through Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 2 and SDG 12) to end hunger and foster sustainable agriculture by enhancing the production and consumption of fruits and vegetables. Previous studies only stressed the various issues in horticulture with regard to industries, but they did not emphasize the centrality of Industry 4.0 technologies for confronting the diverse issues in horticulture, from production to marketing in the context of sustainability. The current study addresses the significance and application of Industry 4.0 technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data for horticulture in enhancing traditional practices for disease detection, irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification, marketing, and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest. On the basis of analysis, the article identifies challenges and suggests a few vital recommendations for future work. In horticulture settings, robotics, drones with vision technology and AI for the detection of pests, weeds, plant diseases, and malnutrition, and edge-computing portable devices that can be developed with IoT and AI for predicting and estimating crop diseases are vital recommendations suggested in the study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ar; Bigdata; Blockchain; Horticulture; Industry 4.0; Iot; Micronutrient; Real-time Prediction; Sdgs,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144829455

Fruit color and size represent two of the most important fruit quality parameters in stone fruit (Prunus sp.). This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of a commercial mobile platform, sensors, and artificial intelligence software system for fast estimates of fruit number, fruit size, and fruit skin color in peach (Prunus persica), nectarine (P. persica var. nucipersica), plum (Prunus salicina), and apricot (Prunus armeniaca), and to assess their spatial and temporal variability. An initial calibration was needed to obtain estimates of absolute fruit number per tree and a forecasted yield. However, the technology can also be used to produce fast relative density maps in stone fruit orchards. Fruit number prediction accuracy was ≥90% in all the crops and training systems under study. Overall, predictions of fruit number in two-dimensional training systems were slightly more accurate. Estimates of fruit diameter (FD) and color did not need an initial calibration. The FD predictions had percent standard errors <10% and root mean square error <5 mm under different training systems, row spacing, crops, and fruit position within the canopy. Hue angle, a color attribute previously associated with fruit maturity in peach and nectarine, was the color attribute that was best predicted by the mobile platform. A new color parameter—color development index (CDI), ranging from 0 to 1—was derived from hue angle. The adoption of CDI, which represents the color progression or distance from green, improved the interpretation of color measurements by end-users as opposed to hue angle and generated more robust color estimations in fruit that turn purple when ripe, such as dark plum. Spatial maps of fruit number, FD, and CDI obtained with the mobile platform can be used to inform orchard decisions such as thinning, pruning, spraying, and harvest timing. The importance and application of crop yield and fruit quality real-time assessments and forecasts are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Computer Vision; Crop Estimation; Hue Angle; Machine Learning; Peach; Prunus Sp,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140340042

Therefore, the mining of genes involved in photosynthesis is important for the study of photosynthesis. MapMan Mercator 4 is a powerful annotation tool for assigning genes into proper functional categories; however, in maize, the functions of approximately 22.15% (9520) of genes remain unclear and are labeled “not assigned”, which may include photosynthesis-related genes that have not yet been identified. The fast-increasing usage of the machine learning approach in solving biological problems provides us with a new chance to identify novel photosynthetic genes from functional “not assigned” genes in maize. Results: In this study, we proved the ensemble learning model using a voting eliminates the preferences of single machine learning models. Based on this evaluation, we implemented an ensemble based ML(Machine Learning) methods using a majority voting scheme and observed that including RNA-seq data from multiple photosynthetic mutants rather than only a single mutant could increase prediction accuracy. And we call this approach “A Machine Learning-based Photosynthetic-related Gene Detection approach (PGD)”. Finally, we predicted 716 photosynthesis-related genes from the “not assigned” category of maize MapMan annotation. The protein localization prediction (TargetP) and expression trends of these genes from maize leaf sections indicated that the prediction was reliable and robust. And we put this approach online base on google colab. Conclusions: This study reveals a new approach for mining novel genes related to a specific functional category and provides candidate genes for researchers to experimentally define their biological functions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ensemble Learning; Functional Category; Machine Learning; Photosynthesis; Rna-seq; Forecasting; Genes; Machine Learning; Photosynthesis; Annotation Tool; Biological Problems; Crop Yield; Detection Approach; Ensemble Learning; Functional Category; Gene Detection; Machine Learning Approaches; Photosynthetic Capacity; Rna-seq; Rna; Article; Gene Expression; Learning; Machine Learning; Maize; Mining; Nonhuman; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaf; Prediction; Protein Localization; Rna Sequencing; Female; Genetics; Human; Metabolism; Pregnancy; Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Plant Leaves; Pregnancy; Preimplantation Diagnosis; Zea Mays,Forecasting; Genes; Machine learning; Photosynthesis; Annotation tool; Biological problems; Crop yield; Detection approach; Ensemble learning; Functional category; Gene detection; Machine learning approaches; Photosynthetic capacity; RNA-seq; RNA; article; gene expression; learning; machine learning; maize; mining; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant leaf; prediction; protein localization; RNA sequencing; female; genetics; human; metabolism; pregnancy; preimplantation genetic diagnosis; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Plant Leaves; Pregnancy; Preimplantation Diagnosis; Zea mays,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130110324

The flower parts of broccoli contain protein, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin C, and many more. However, in its cultivation, broccoli plants have obstacles such as the presence of pests and diseases that can affect production of broccoli. To avoid this, the authors build a model to identify diseases in broccoli through leaf images with a size of 128x128 pixels. The model is constructed to classify healthy leaves, and disease leaves using the image processing method that uses machine learning stages. There are several stages, including K-Means segmentation, colour feature extraction, and classification using SVM (Support Vector Machine) with RBF kernel and PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) for reduce dimensionality data. The model that has been built compares the SVM model and the SVM-PSO model. It produces good accuracy in the training of 97.63% and testing accuracy of 94.48% for SVM-PSO and 85.82% for training, and 86.25% for testing in the SVM model.

Early detection of individuals at high risk of future progression toward AD is likely to be of critical significance for the successful treatment and/or prevention of this devastating disease. In this paper, we present an empirical study to characterize how predictable an individual subjects’ future AD trajectory is, several years in advance, based on rich multi-modal data, and using modern deep learning methods. Crucially, the machine learning strategy we propose can handle different future time horizons and can be trained with heterogeneous data that exhibit missingness and non-uniform follow-up visit times. Our experiments demonstrate that our strategy yields predictions that are more accurate than a model trained on a single time horizon (e.g. 3 years), which is common practice in prior literature. We also provide a comparison between linear and nonlinear models, verifying the well-established insight that the latter can offer a boost in performance. Our results also confirm that predicting future decline for cognitively normal (CN) individuals is more challenging than for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Intriguingly, however, we discover that prediction accuracy decreases with increasing time horizon for CN subjects, but the trend is in the opposite direction for MCI subjects. Additionally, we quantify the contribution of different data types in prediction, which yields novel insights into the utility of different biomarkers. We find that molecular biomarkers are not as helpful for CN individuals as they are for MCI individuals, whereas magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers (hippocampus volume, specifically) offer a significant boost in prediction accuracy for CN individuals. Finally, we show how our model’s prediction reveals the evolution of individual-level progression risk over a five-year time horizon.

Thus, this article reviews AI application in various unit operations for mineral concentration. Because unit operations for mineral concentration deal with yields not necessarily linearly correlated with input variables, subsequent yield prediction using AI can add value to their control. The current applications of AI have neglected fundamental variables (e.g., particle agglomeration, particle magnetic susceptibility, particle wettability, particle surface charge, and particle Hamaker constant) as inputs for prediction. Instrumentation and industrial simplicity have hindered the consideration of those variables because validation is required. There are kind learning (repeated patterns and high accuracy measurements) and wicked learning (continuously novel patterns and noise in measurements) environments, which are suitable and challenging for machine learning, respectively. Kind learning environments were largely used for the applications of AI.

The spoilage rates differed between genotypes, and this was highly correlated over two successive years. Among seventeen genotypes, a more intense red coloration of the fruit skin was associated with a lower spoilage rate (r = –0.63). Additionally, weakly negative correlations were found between the levels of anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, malic acid and spoilage rates. No clear correlations were found between spoilage rates and soluble sugars, most volatiles, firmness and dry weight percentage. High levels of two volatile compounds, ethyl butanoate (r = 0.55) and 1-hexanol (r = 0.61), were correlated to high spoilage rates.

In this paper, we propose an application of advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms to address two most crucial objectives of column integrity breach and yield prediction for resin cycling study of protein A chromatography. Two approaches have been considered to detect anomalies in case of column integrity breach. The first approach utilized the traditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method for dimensionality reduction followed by anomaly detection using Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm. The second approach involved the application of deep learning neural network based Long Short Term Memory autoencoder (LSTM AE). Both the algorithms could successfully predict the column integrity failure 4 cycles ahead of the actual cycle. In the case of prediction of percentage yield decay, a partial least squares-artificial neural network (PLS-ANN) augmented model was utilized and compared with the traditional PLS regression model. The developed PLS-ANN model with higher R2 and lower RMSE values of 0.96 and 0.014 respectively could outperform the classical PLS model with lower R2 and RMSE values of 0.88 and 0.028, resulting in more accurate yield prediction. The developed ML algorithms for both case studies could not only successfully forecast anomalies by detecting subtle changes in column packing quality and thereby facilitate real time control decisions for preventive measures, a prerequisite for continuous manufacturing, but also demonstrated the ability to predict complex yield decay behaviour for protein A chromatography. As biopharmaceutical manufacturing adopts continuous processing, copious amount of data will be generated from the process and analytical equipment on the manufacturing floor, and the proposed advanced ML algorithms have significant potential in dealing with nonlinearities of the different unit operations simultaneously and facilitate real-time control decision making. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Continuous Processing; Machine Learning (ml); Protein A Chromatography; Resin Cycling; Bevifimod; Biological Products; Staphylococcal Protein A; Epoch; Column Chromatography; Decision Making; Forecasting; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Least Squares Approximations; Long Short-term Memory; Principal Component Analysis; Proteins; Quality Control; Radial Basis Function Networks; Real Time Control; Regression Analysis; Anomaly Detection; Column Integrities; Continuous Processing; Machine Learning; Machine Learning Algorithms; Machine-learning; Partial Least-squares; Protein A Chromatography; Resin Cycling; Yield Prediction; Resins; Monoclonal Antibody; Protein A; Bevifimod; Biological Product; Algorithm; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Autoencoder; Chromatography; Decision Making; Learning Algorithm; Long Short Term Memory Network; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Nonlinear System; Outlier Detection; Partial Least Squares Regression; Prediction; Principal Component Analysis; Steady State; Metabolism; Algorithms; Biological Products; Chromatography; Machine Learning; Staphylococcal Protein A,Column chromatography; Decision making; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Long short-term memory; Principal component analysis; Proteins; Quality control; Radial basis function networks; Real time control; Regression analysis; Anomaly detection; Column integrities; Continuous processing; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Partial least-squares; Protein A chromatography; Resin cycling; Yield prediction; Resins; monoclonal antibody; protein A; bevifimod; biological product; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; autoencoder; chromatography; decision making; learning algorithm; long short term memory network; machine learning; nonhuman; nonlinear system; outlier detection; partial least squares regression; prediction; principal component analysis; steady state; metabolism; Algorithms; Biological Products; Chromatography; Machine Learning; Staphylococcal Protein A,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138442788

Automatic detection of cassava leaf disease using novel techniques assists humans in monitoring the huge farm of crops manually. Early detection of the disease symptoms on plant leaves is a better option to avoid spreading diseases throughout the farmland.

This fruit has a fibrous structure and contains plenty of vitamins. Tomato diseases are generally observed on stem, fruit, and leaves. Early diagnosis of the disease in plants is of vital importance for the plant. This is very important for farmers who expect economic gain from that plant. Because if the disease is not treated early, these tomatoes should be destroyed. For these reasons, systems to diagnose the disease early are very important. In this study, a tomato leaf diseases classification model developed with deep learning methods, which is one of the most popular artificial intelligence techniques, is proposed in order to eliminate the possibility of the human eye being mistaken. In this study, 6 different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were used. In the first stage of this study, which consists of two stages, the classification process was carried out with the Alexnet, Googlenet, Shufflenet, Efficientb0, Resnet50, and Inceptionv3 architectures that were previously trained. In the second stage, feature maps of tomato leaf images in the dataset were obtained using the six pre-trained deep learning architectures. In the hybrid model proposed in this study, the feature maps extracted using the best two of the six deep learning models are concatenated. Then, the Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) method was applied to the extracted features in order to speed up the system, unnecessary features were removed and optimized. The optimized feature map is classified by traditional intelligent classification models. As a result of experimental studies, the average accuracy rate of the proposed model is 99.50 percent. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Classifiers; Cnn; Machine Learning; Nca; Tomato Leaf Image; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Image Classification; Learning Systems; Network Architecture; Plants (botany); Automated Detection; Classification Models; Convolutional Neural Network; Feature Map; Leaf Disease; Leaf Images; Machine-learning; Neighborhood Component Analysis; Tomato Leaf; Tomato Leaf Image; Fruits,Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image classification; Learning systems; Network architecture; Plants (botany); Automated detection; Classification models; Convolutional neural network; Feature map; Leaf disease; Leaf images; Machine-learning; Neighborhood component analysis; Tomato leaf; Tomato leaf image; Fruits,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150168311

Heatwaves and drought, which are among the top stressors, commonly co-occur, and their frequency is increasing with global climate change. High-throughput methods were optimized to phenotype wheat plants under controlled water deficit and high temperature, with the aim to identify phenotypic traits conferring adaptative stress responses. Wheat plants of 10 genotypes were grown in a fully automated plant facility under 25/18 °C day/night for 30 d, and then the temperature was increased for 7 d (38/31 °C day/night) while maintaining half of the plants well irrigated and half at 30% field capacity. Thermal and multispectral images and pot weights were registered twice daily. At the end of the experiment, key metabolites and enzyme activities from carbohydrate and antioxidant metabolism were quantified. Regression machine learning models were successfully established to predict plant biomass using image-extracted parameters. Evapotranspiration traits expressed significant genotype-environment interactions (G×E) when acclimatization to stress was continuously monitored. Consequently, transpiration efficiency was essential to maintain the balance between water-saving strategies and biomass production in wheat under water deficit and high temperature. Stress tolerance included changes in carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in the sucrolytic and glycolytic pathways, and in antioxidant metabolism. The observed genetic differences in sensitivity to high temperature and water deficit can be exploited in breeding programmes to improve wheat resilience to climate change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Carbohydrate Metabolism; Climate Change; Drought Resilience; Food Security; High Temperature; High-throughput Plant Phenotyping; Multispectral Imaging; Triticum Aestivum; Water Deficit; Wheat,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144731827

Cti6 is a nuclear protein containing a plant homeodomain (PHD) that is involved in transcriptional regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biological function of its homologous protein in M. oryzae has been elusive. Here, we report Clp1 with a PHD domain in M. oryzae, a homologous protein of the yeast Cti6. Clp1 was mainly located in the nucleus and partly in the vesicles. Clp1 colocalized and interacted with the autophagy-related proteins Atg5, Atg7, Atg16, Atg24, and Atg28 at preautophagosomal structures (PAS) and autophagosomes, and the loss of Clp1 increased the fungal background autophagy level. Dclp1 displayed reduced hyphal growth and hyperbranching, abnormal fungal morphology (including colony, spore, and appressorium), hindered appressorial glycogen metabolism and turgor production, weakened plant infection, and decreased virulence. The PHD is indispensable for the function of Clp1. Therefore, this study revealed that Clp1 regulates development and pathogenicity by maintaining autophagy homeostasis and affecting gene transcription in M. oryzae. IMPORTANCE The fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae causes serious diseases of grasses such as rice and wheat. Autophagy plays an indispensable role in the pathogenic process of M. oryzae. Here, we report a Cti6-like protein, Clp1, that is involved in fungal development and infection of plants through controlling autophagy homeostasis in the cytoplasm and gene transcription in the nucleus in M. oryzae.

White leaf disease (WLD) occurs predominantly in some Asian countries and is a devastating global threat to sugarcane industries, especially Sri Lanka. Therefore, a feasible and an effective approach to precisely monitoring WLD infection is important, especially at the early pre-visual stage. This work presents the first approach on the preliminary detection of sugarcane WLD by using high-resolution multispectral sensors mounted on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and supervised machine learning classifiers. The detection pipeline discussed in this paper was validated in a sugarcane field located in Gal-Oya Plantation, Hingurana, Sri Lanka. The pixelwise segmented samples were classified as ground, shadow, healthy plant, early symptom, and severe symptom. Four ML algorithms, namely XGBoost (XGB), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), were implemented along with different python libraries, vegetation indices (VIs), and five spectral bands to detect the WLD in the sugarcane field. The accuracy rate of 94% was attained in the XGB, RF, and KNN to detect WLD in the field. The top three vegetation indices (VIs) for separating healthy and infected sugarcane crops are modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and excess green (ExG) in XGB, RF, and DT, while the best spectral band is red in XGB and RF and green in DT.

Machine learning algorithms were evaluated to determine Arabica coffee yield. The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) rpart1SE algorithm used for classification and regression provided crucial nutrient thresholds to obtain high yield and minimise yield variability, by increasing vigour in well-nourished plants, with fertiliser management in the field. The use of the random forest model enabled to detect the most important variables for predicting coffee yield, as well as to identify how the nutritional status of the plants, such as Mg, Fe and Ca contents can be balanced to maximise yield. Variables related to the coffee nutritional status were more important than remote sensing variables for estimating coffee yield in the field. Despite the better accuracy of the random forest model (rf) to predict coffee yield when compared to the rpart1SE model, the particularity of each machine learning algorithm modelling was used in terms of the benefits of the results of each methodology synergistically in favour of wisely defining the best strategy and tactics for the crop management. In general, Mg leaf content was the most important variable for yield class prediction in both the 2005 and 2006 harvests by the rf model. The CART algorithm defined Mg leaf content threshold <3.615 g kg−1 in 6/15/2005 for yield classification in the first node and this threshold obtained is consistent with the available literature associated with high coffee yields between 3.6 and 4.0 g kg−1. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Coffee Management; Data Mining; Mineral Nutrition; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Spectral Data; Crops; Data Mining; Decision Trees; Forecasting; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Nutrition; Remote Sensing; Classification Trees; Coffee Management; Crop Yield; Machine Learning Algorithms; Machine-learning; Mineral Nutrition; Precision Agriculture; Random Forest Modeling; Remote-sensing; Spectral Data; Precision Agriculture,Crops; Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Nutrition; Remote sensing; Classification trees; Coffee management; Crop yield; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Mineral nutrition; Precision Agriculture; Random forest modeling; Remote-sensing; Spectral data; Precision agriculture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133805854

We trained the U-Net architecture with ResNet50 as the encoder block using 1385 RGB images collected under different conditions and various heights. We utilized the combination of the dice and focal losses as a custom linear loss function to overcome imbalanced data and small area segmentation challenges. The structure of the dataset for the training process and using the custom loss function led to a model with the accuracy and intersection over union (IoU) score of 0.9606 and 0.8423, respectively. The results showed that using the image dataset with proper distribution and custom loss function can improve segmentation accuracy, especially in small regions.

However, determining the Ca2+-signaling specificity to various stimuli in these mutants remains a challenge. For instance, less is known about the exact selectivity between osmotic and ionic stresses in the osca1 mutant. Here, we have developed a method to distinguish the osmotic and ionic effects by analyzing Ca2+ increases, and demonstrated that osca1 is impaired primarily in Ca2+ increases induced by the osmotic but not ionic stress. We recorded Ca2+ increases induced by sorbitol (osmotic effect, OE) and NaCl/CaCl<inf>2</inf> (OE + ionic effect, IE) in Arabidopsis wild-type and osca1 seedlings. We assumed the NaCl/CaCl<inf>2</inf> total effect (TE) = OE + IE, then developed procedures for Ca2+ imaging, image analysis and mathematic fitting/modeling, and found osca1 defects mainly in OE. The osmotic specificity of osca1 suggests that osmotic and ionic perceptions are independent.

The objective of this study is to predict the regional sugarcane crop yield for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) province using analysis-ready moderate-resolution satellite images. The four machine learning regression algorithms, namely support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting regression (GBR), eXtreme gradient boosting regression (XGB), and random forest regression (RF), were used to train and predict the district-wise sugarcane yield in UP. Standard MODIS data products such as leaf area index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), latent heat flux (LE), and gross primary product (GPP) were obtained for a period of eighteen years, and their monthly average was extracted and used as features in the model. The models were trained using eighty percent of the observations with the annual district-wise sugarcane yield as the response variable. Iterative feature selection was done based on correlation factor and feature importance to reduce the dimensionality of the data from around a hundred features to twenty-four. The R2 metric was used as the evaluation metric to choose the best predictive model. The study showed results with moderate accuracy and was used to estimate the sugarcane crop yield for the year 2019. The highest R2 of 0.66 and an RMSE value of 7.15 t/ha were obtained using the GBR algorithm by using seven variables and 24 features. The model was very closely followed by the XGB model with an R2 of 0.65 and an RMSE value of 7.20 t/ha. The FPAR-based features contributed the most to the model followed by the LAI and NDVI features. The simple methodology used in the study uses ready-to-use satellite products and has operationalization potential. The model can be improved by incorporating more satellite-derived parameters and an accurate crop mask to avoid spectral interference from other cropland. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fpar; Gradient Boosting; Modis; Random Forest; Regional; Sugarcane; Xgboost; Yield Prediction; Crop; Evapotranspiration; Latent Heat Flux; Machine Learning; Photosynthetically Active Radiation; Vegetation Index; India; Uttar Pradesh,crop; evapotranspiration; latent heat flux; machine learning; photosynthetically active radiation; vegetation index; India; Uttar Pradesh,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128610931

One prominent role of antimicrobial autophagy is to degrade intracellular pathogens or microbial molecules, in a process termed xenophagy. Consequently, microbes evolved mechanisms to hijack or modulate autophagy to escape elimination. Although well-described in animals, the extent to which xenophagy contributes to plant–bacteria interactions remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence that Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) suppresses host autophagy by utilizing type-III effector XopL. XopL interacts with and degrades the autophagy component SH3P2 via its E3 ligase activity to promote infection. Intriguingly, XopL is targeted for degradation by defense-related selective autophagy mediated by NBR1/Joka2, revealing a complex antagonistic interplay between XopL and the host autophagy machinery. Our results implicate plant antimicrobial autophagy in the depletion of a bacterial virulence factor and unravel an unprecedented pathogen strategy to counteract defense-related autophagy in plant–bacteria interactions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Autophagy; Effectors; Immunity; Ubiquitination; Xenophagy; Concanamycin A; Ubiquitin Protein Ligase; Virulence Factors; Cfx; Genematrix; Imagej; Lsm780; Lsm880; Lunascript; Nanodrop 2000; Q Exactive; Concanamycin A; Protein Sh3; Ubiquitin Protein Ligase; Virulence Factor; Affinity Chromatography; Agrobacterium Tumefaciens; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Article; Autophagy (cellular); Bacterial Growth; Bacterial Load; Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy; Confocal Microscopy; Controlled Study; Enzyme Activity; Escherichia Coli; Gene; Gene Expression; Gene Silencing; High Performance Liquid Chromatography; Homeostasis; Host Microbe Interaction; Image Analysis; Immunoblotting; Immunoprecipitation; Infection; Infectious Agent; Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Luciferase Assay; Mass Spectrometry; Nicotiana Benthamiana; Nonhuman; Pathogenicity; Phylogenetic Tree; Plant Bacterium Interaction; Protein Expression; Rna Extraction; Tomato; Tumor Suppressor Gene; Ubiquitination; Western Blotting; Xanthomonas; Xanthomonas Campestris; Xanthomonas Vesicatoria; Xenophagy; Xopl Gene; Xopq Gene; Animal; Autophagy; Bacterium; Genetics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant Disease; Animals; Autophagy; Bacteria; Host-pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Virulence Factors,concanamycin A; protein SH3; ubiquitin protein ligase; virulence factor; affinity chromatography; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; autophagy (cellular); bacterial growth; bacterial load; confocal laser scanning microscopy; confocal microscopy; controlled study; enzyme activity; Escherichia coli; gene; gene expression; gene silencing; high performance liquid chromatography; homeostasis; host microbe interaction; image analysis; immunoblotting; immunoprecipitation; infection; infectious agent; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; luciferase assay; mass spectrometry; Nicotiana benthamiana; nonhuman; pathogenicity; phylogenetic tree; plant bacterium interaction; protein expression; RNA extraction; tomato; tumor suppressor gene; ubiquitination; Western blotting; Xanthomonas; Xanthomonas campestris; Xanthomonas vesicatoria; xenophagy; xopL gene; xopQ gene; animal; autophagy; bacterium; genetics; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; microbiology; plant disease; Animals; Autophagy; Bacteria; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Virulence Factors,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130595576

So, agriculture is considered the backbone of any nation. Mango (Mangifera indica Linn), belonging to a family Anacardiaceous, is a conspicuous fruit that captivates all ages because of its meticulous taste, delicious flavor, ampleness variety, and highly lustiness. Mangoes are generally rich in minerals, vitamins, fibers, and negotiable fat. Mango plants are exposed to many micro-organisms. If these are not detected and treated in the initial developing stages, it would affect peculiar parts of the mango plant and result in loss of overall productivity. Several factors like biotic and abiotic always ensue in the decrease in the overall productivity of mango plants. Self-regulated Detection of mango plant disease is imperative, and it must be detected at the preliminary stages of the growing period of the mango plant. This paper discusses the existing methodology to classify diseases in mango plant leaves by implementing ensemble technique (Stack) which includes algorithms like Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Logistic Regression (LR). The developmental results validate that the disease classification methodology can successfully classify a higher percentage in predicting whether mango plant leaf is healthy or diseased. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adam Optimizer; Classification; Decision Tree; Logistic Regression; Machine Learning; Neural Network; Support Vector Machine,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136857585

Early detection of diseases and pests of corn aims to reduce the possibility of crop failure and maintain the quality and quantity of crop yields. A decision tree is a nonparametric classification model in statistical machine learning that predicts target variables using tree-structured decisions. The performance of this model can increase significantly if the continuous predictor variables are discretized into valid categories. However, in some cases, the result does not provide satisfactory performance. The possible cause is the ambiguity in discretizing predictor variables. The incorporation of fuzzy membership functions into the model to resolve discretization ambiguity issues. This work aims to classify diseases and pests of corn plants using the decision tree model and improve the model’s performance by implementing fuzzy membership functions. The main contribution of this work is that we have shown a significant improvement in the decision tree model performance by implementing fuzzy membership functions; S-growth, triangle, and S-shrinkage curves. The proposed fuzzy model is better than the decision tree model, with an average performance increase from the largest to the smallest; kappa (12.16%), recall (11.8%), F-score (9.71%), precision (5.08%), accuracy (3.23%), specificity (1.94%), and AUC (0.49%).

Alternately, aerial imagery can be explored to predict yield-related components and high-throughput phenotyping for genetic selection. In this study, aerial imagery and ground data were collected in Stage IV (final stage of genotype selection) of the Florida sugarcane cultivar development program to evaluate the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in yield prediction (tons of cane per hectare [TCH], sucrose concentration, and tons of sugar per hectare [TSH]) in multiple new genotypes (13 in plant cane crop, nine in first ratoon crop). Aerial imagery data were collected using hyperspectral sensor, and yield data were collected through manual sampling of sugarcane stalks at harvest. The gradient-boosting regression tree model was selected based on low mean absolute percentage error on multiple dates (April, July, and September) to determine the best timing of yield predictions. Results showed that yield was predicted with greater accuracy in July in plant crop and April in the first ratoon crop. Also, sucrose percentage was predicted with greater accuracy (94% in plant crop and 93% in first ratoon crop) than TCH and TSH. Although only two out of the top five genotypes were common in both selection methods (measured vs. predicted yields) in Stage IV, high accuracy in TCH and sucrose percentage shows that aerial imagery may be useful in making genotype selection in early stages when actual yield estimation is not feasible. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134478000

Traditional manual disease detection relies on farm experts and is often time-consuming. Computer vision technologies and artificial intelligence could provide automatic disease detection for real-time controlling the spread of disease on the grapevine in precision viticulture. To achieve the best trade-off between GDM detection accuracy and speed under natural environments, a deep learning based approach named YOLOv5-CA is proposed in this study. Here coordinate attention (CA) mechanism is integrated into YOLOv5, which highlights the downy mildew disease-related visual features to enhance the detection performance. A challenging GDM dataset was acquired in a vineyard under a nature scene (consisting of different illuminations, shadows, and backgrounds) to test the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed YOLOv5-CA achieved a detection precision of 85.59%, a recall of 83.70%, and a mAP@0.5 of 89.55%, which is superior to the popular methods, including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, and YOLOv5. Furthermore, our proposed approach with inference occurring at 58.82 frames per second, could be deployed for the real-time disease control requirement. In addition, the proposed YOLOv5-CA based approach could effectively capture leaf disease related visual features resulting in higher GDE detection accuracy. Overall, this study provides a favorable deep learning based approach for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of grape leaf diseases in the field of automatic disease detection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attention Mechanism; Data Augmentation; Deep Learning; Digital Agriculture; Disease Detection; Grape Downy Mildew,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133449475

This grid intended to retrieve the representative soil mapping unit of each geometric polygon. It was retrieved 117,413 points representing 27 SMU of seven soil orders at a first categorical level, according to the Brazilian Classification System, and seven yield environment for sugarcane production. SMU predictions and their respective soil orders were performed using the random forest machine learning regression method. The level of association between SMU and yield environments was 0.34 (α = 0.01) by the Cramer's V coefficient with a very strong relationship. Our approach could provide the first digital yield environment for sugarcane based on the DSM products. Furthermore, a qualitative evaluation of our framework was substantiated with previous research in the same study site. This framework could be replicated and fulfil the need for DSM at regional and farm levels for policy-makers and farmers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Digital Soil Mapping; Pedometrics; Remote Sensing; Sugarcane Yield; Agricultural Practice; Crop Yield; Digital Mapping; Pedomorphosis; Remote Sensing; Sugar Cane; Yield Response; Brazil; Sao Paulo [brazil],agricultural practice; crop yield; digital mapping; pedomorphosis; remote sensing; sugar cane; yield response; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132358541

Accurate identification of plant R proteins is an important research topic in plant pathology. Plant R protein prediction has achieved many research results. Recently, some machine learning-based methods have emerged to identify plant R proteins. Still, most of them only rely on protein sequence features, which ignore inter-amino acid features, thus limiting the further improvement of plant R protein prediction performance. In this manuscript, we propose a method called StackRPred to predict plant R proteins. Specifically, the StackRPred first obtains plant R protein feature information from the pairwise energy content of residues; then, the obtained feature information is fed into the stacking framework for training to construct a prediction model for plant R proteins. The results of both the five-fold cross-validation and independent test validation show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, indicating that StackRPred is an effective tool for predicting plant R proteins. It is expected to bring some favorable contribution to the study of plant R proteins. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Discrete Wavelet Transform; Feature Representation; Pairwise Energy Content; Plant Resistance Protein; Stacking,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132368747

The recognition accuracy of traditional deep learning models is not high, and the chemical analysis operation process of soybean diseases is time-consuming. In addition, artificial observation and experience judgment are easily affected by subjective factors and difficult to guarantee the accuracy of the objective. Thus, a rapid identification method of soybean diseases was proposed based on a new residual attention network (RANet) model. First, soybean brown leaf spot, soybean frogeye leaf spot, and soybean phyllosticta leaf spot were used as research objects, the OTSU algorithm was adopted to remove the background from the original image. Then, the sample dataset of soybean disease images was expanded by image enhancement technology based on a single leaf image of soybean disease. In addition, a residual attention layer (RAL) was constructed using attention mechanisms and shortcut connections, which further embedded into the residual neural network 18 (ResNet18) model. Finally, a new model of RANet for recognition of soybean diseases was established based on attention mechanism and idea of residuals. The result showed that the average recognition accuracy of soybean leaf diseases was 98.49%, and the F1-value was 98.52 with recognition time of 0.0514 s, which realized an accurate, fast, and efficient recognition model for soybean leaf diseases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attention Mechanism; Recognition Model; Residual Network; Shortcut Connections; Soybean Diseases,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132243119

Predicting ubiquitination is an important technical method for plant protection. Traditional ubiquitination site determination methods are costly and time-consuming, while computational-based prediction methods can accurately and efficiently predict ubiquitination sites. At present, capsule networks and deep learning are used alone for prediction, and the effect is not obvious. The capsule network reflects the spatial position relationship of the internal features of the neural network, but it cannot identify long-distance dependencies or focus on amino acids in protein sequences or their degree of importance. In this study, we investigated the use of convolutional neural networks and capsule networks in deep learning to design a novel model “Caps-Ubi,” first using the one-hot and amino acid continuous type hybrid encoding method to characterize ubiquitination sites. The sequence patterns, the dependencies between the encoded protein sequences and the important amino acids in the captured sequences, were then focused on the importance of amino acids in the sequences through the proposed Caps-Ubi model and used for multispecies ubiquitination site prediction. Through relevant experiments, the proposed Caps-Ubi method is superior to other similar methods in predicting ubiquitination sites. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Capsule Network; Hybrid Encoding; Plant Protection; Protein Ubiquitination; Site Prediction,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131855717

Mango fruit is one of the most popular and desirable fruits worldwide due to its taste and richness in vitamins. However, plant diseases also affect these plants’ production and quality. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based metaheuristic approach for disease diagnosis and detection. The proposed approach involves preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and disease classification. First, the image of mango leaves is enhanced using histogram equalization and contrast enhancement. Then, a geometric mean-based neutrosophic with a fuzzy c-means method is used for segmentation. Next, the essential features are retrieved from the segmented images, including the Upgraded Local Binary Pattern (ULBP), color, and pixel features. Finally, these features are given into the disease detection phase, which is modeled using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (deep learning model). Furthermore, to enhance the classification accuracy of CNN, the weights are fine-tuned using a new hybrid optimization model referred to as Cat Swarm Updated Black Widow Model (CSUBW). The new hybrid optimization model is developed by hybridizing the standard Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSO) and Black Widow Optimization Algorithm (BWO).

Non-destructive methods, such as proximal and remote sensing, are commonly used to estimate crop yield and quality characteristics, and spectral vegetation indices (VIs) are often used to present site-specific information. Analysis of laboratory samples is the most popular method for determining the quality characteristics of grapes, although it is time-consuming and expensive. In recent years, several machine learning-based methods have been developed to predict crop quality. Although these techniques require the extensive involvement of experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) offers the possibility to improve this task, saving time and resources. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for robust prediction of grape quality attributes by combining open-source AutoML techniques and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for vineyards obtained from four different platforms-two proximal vehicle-mounted canopy reflectance sensors, orthomosaics from UAV images and Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery-during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons. We investigated AutoML, extending our earlier work on manually fine-tuned machine learning methods. Results of the two approaches using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Theil-Sen and Huber regression models and tree-based methods were compared. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) were included in the analysis and different combinations of sensors and data collected over two growing seasons were investigated. Results showed promising performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Spectrosense+ GPS data in predicting grape sugars, especially in mid to late season with full canopy growth. Regression models with both manually fine-tuned ML (R2 = 0.61) and AutoML (R2 = 0.65) provided similar results, with the latter slightly improved for both 2019 and 2020. When combining multiple sensors and growth stages per year, the coefficient of determination R2 improved even more averaging 0.66 for the best-fitting regressions. Also, when considering combinations of sensors and growth stages across both cropping seasons, UAV and Spectrosense+ GPS, as well as Véraison and Flowering, each had the highest average R2 values. These performances are consistent with previous work on machine learning algorithms that were manually fine-tuned. These results suggest that AutoML has greater long-term performance potential. To increase the efficiency of crop quality prediction, a balance must be struck between manual expert work and AutoML. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Automl; Bayesian Optimization; Correlation; Ensemble Methods; Ndvi; Quality Prediction; Sugars; Sugars; Antennas; Correlation Methods; Crops; Forecasting; Global Positioning System; Learning Algorithms; Least Squares Approximations; Nondestructive Examination; Quality Control; Remote Sensing; Sugars; Support Vector Machines; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Vegetation; Automated Machine Learning; Bayesian Optimization; Correlation; Crop Quality; Ensemble Methods; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Datum; Quality Attributes; Quality Characteristic; Quality Prediction; Regression Analysis; Carbohydrate; Agricultural Land; Machine Learning; Procedures; Remote Sensing; Vitis; Farms; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing Technology,Antennas; Correlation methods; Crops; Forecasting; Global positioning system; Learning algorithms; Least squares approximations; Nondestructive examination; Quality control; Remote sensing; Sugars; Support vector machines; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Automated machine learning; Bayesian optimization; Correlation; Crop quality; Ensemble methods; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized difference vegetation index datum; Quality attributes; Quality characteristic; Quality prediction; Regression analysis; carbohydrate; agricultural land; machine learning; procedures; remote sensing; Vitis; Farms; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing Technology,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128765055

This is enabled by combining the use of cheap high-quality cameras with recent advances in deep learning compute solutions to derive relevant thematic information. We present a framework to collect and extract crop type and phenological information from street level imagery using computer vision. Monitoring crop phenology is critical to assess gross primary productivity and crop yield. During the 2018 growing season, high-definition pictures were captured with side-looking action cameras in the Flevoland province of the Netherlands. Each month from March to October, a fixed 200-km route was surveyed collecting one picture per second resulting in a total of 400,000 geo-tagged pictures. At 220 specific parcel locations, detailed on the spot crop phenology observations were recorded for 17 crop types (including bare soil, green manure, and tulips): bare soil, carrots, green manure, grassland, grass seeds, maize, onion, potato, summer barley, sugar beet, spring cereals, spring wheat, tulips, vegetables, winter barley, winter cereals and winter wheat. Furthermore, the time span included specific pre-emergence parcel stages, such as differently cultivated bare soil for spring and summer crops as well as post-harvest cultivation practices, e.g. green manuring and catch crops. Classification was done using TensorFlow with a well-known image recognition model, based on transfer learning with convolutional neural network (MobileNet). A hypertuning methodology was developed to obtain the best performing model among 160 models. This best model was applied on an independent inference set discriminating crop type with a Macro F1 score of 88.1% and main phenological stage at 86.9% at the parcel level. Potential and caveats of the approach along with practical considerations for implementation and improvement are discussed.

Although viral nuclear entry promotes viral replication in host cells, whether this phenomenon occurs in vector cells remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, we systematically evaluated the presence and roles of RSV in the nuclei of vector insect cells. We observed that the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and viral genomic RNAs were partially transported into vector cell nuclei by utilizing the importin α nuclear transport system. When blocking NP nuclear localization, cytoplasmic RSV accumulation significantly increased. In the vector cell nuclei, NP bound the transcription factor YY1 and affected its positive regulation to FAIM. Subsequently, decreased FAIM expression triggered an antiviral caspase-dependent apoptotic reaction.

This method can solve the problems of noise, background interference, and low detection accuracy of maize leaf disease images. To begin, a processing layer called Wavelet threshold guided bilateral filtering (WT-GBF) based on the WG-MARNet model is employed to reduce image noise and perform high and low-frequency decomposition of the input image using WT-GBF. This increases the input image’s resistance to environmental interference and feature extraction capability. Secondly, for the multiscale feature fusion technique, an average down-sampling and tiling method is employed to increase feature representation and limit the risk of overfitting. Then, on high and low-frequency multi-channel, an attenuation factor is introduced to optimize the performance instability during training of the deep network. Finally, when the convergence and accuracy are compared, PRelu and Adabound are used instead of the Relu activation function and the Adam optimizer. The experimental results revealed that our method’s average recognition accuracy was 97.96%, and the detection time for a single image was 0.278 seconds. The average detection accuracy has been increased.

Accurate prediction of plant phosphorylation sites (p-sites) is vital as abnormal regulation of phosphorylation usually leads to plant diseases. However, current experimental methods for PTM prediction suffers from high-computational cost and are error-prone. The present study develops machine learning-based prediction techniques, including a high-performance interpretable deep tabular learning network (TabNet) to improve the prediction of protein p-sites in soybean. Moreover, we use a hybrid feature set of sequential-based features, physicochemical properties and position-specific scoring matrices to predict serine (Ser/S), threonine (Thr/T) and tyrosine (Tyr/Y) p-sites in soybean for the first time. The experimentally verified p-sites data of soybean proteins are collected from the eukaryotic phosphorylation sites database and database post-translational modification. We then remove the redundant set of positive and negative samples by dropping protein sequences with >40% similarity. It is found that the developed techniques perform >70% in terms of accuracy. The results demonstrate that the TabNet model is the best performing classifier using hybrid features and with window size of 13, resulted in 78.96 and 77.24% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The results indicate that the TabNet method has advantages in terms of high-performance and interpretability. The proposed technique can automatically analyze the data without any measurement errors and any human intervention. Furthermore, it can be used to predict putative protein p-sites in plants effectively.

In addition to high yield, grain quality traits are of high importance for farmers. The strong influence of climatic conditions makes the improvement of grain quality traits, like protein content, vitreousness, and test weight, a challenging task. Evaluation of quality traits post-harvest is time- and labor-intensive and requires expensive equipment, such as near-infrared spectroscopes or hyperspectral imagers. Predicting not only yield but also important quality traits in the field before harvest is of high value for breeders aiming to optimize resource allocation. Implementation of efficient approaches for trait prediction, such as the use of high-resolution spectral data acquired by a multispectral camera mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), needs to be explored. In this study, we have acquired multispectral image data with an 11-band multispectral camera mounted on a UAV and analyzed the data with machine learning (ML) models to predict grain yield and important quality traits in breeding micro-plots. Combining 11-band multispectral data for 34 cultivars and 16 environments allowed to develop ML models with good prediction capability. Applying the trained models to test sets explained a considerable degree of phenotypic variance with good accuracy showing r squared values of 0.84, 0.69, 0.64, and 0.61 and normalized root mean squared errors of 0.17, 0.07, 0.14, and 0.03 for grain yield, protein content, vitreousness, and test weight, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Durum Wheat; Grain Yield; Machine Learning; Multispectral Imaging; Protein Content; Quality Trait Prediction; Test Weight; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Vitreousness; Yield Prediction; Antennas; Cameras; Grain (agricultural Product); Infrared Devices; Machine Learning; Mean Square Error; Proteins; Spectroscopy; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Durum Wheats; Grain Quality; Grain Yield; Multispectral Cameras; Multispectral Imaging; Protein Contents; Quality Trait Prediction; Test Weight; Vitreousness; Yield Prediction; Forecasting; Data; Forecasts; Grain; Quality; Yield; Food Grain; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Wheat; Edible Grain; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Triticum,Antennas; Cameras; Grain (agricultural product); Infrared devices; Machine learning; Mean square error; Proteins; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Durum wheats; Grain quality; Grain yield; Multispectral cameras; Multispectral imaging; Protein contents; Quality trait prediction; Test weight; Vitreousness; Yield prediction; Forecasting; Data; Forecasts; Grain; Quality; Yield; food grain; phenotype; plant breeding; wheat; Edible Grain; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Triticum,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124474921

Eroded soils lead to reduced crop yields and deprived agroecosystem's functioning through, for example, decreased water holding capacity, poor aeration, scarce microbial activity, and loose soil structure. This can result in reduced carbon sequestration, limited nutrient cycling, contamination of water bodies due to eutrophication, low protection from floods and poor attention restoration-consequences that go far beyond the commonly modelled soil loss and deposition budgets. This book demonstrates, using data from the Harod catchment in northern Israel, how cutting-edge geoinformatics, data science methodologies and soil health indicators can be used to measure, predict, and regulate these major environmental hazards. It shows how these approaches are used to quantify-in time and space-the effect of water erosion not only on the soil layer, soil minerals, and soil loss, but also on the wide-range of services that agricultural ecosystems might supply for the benefit and well-being of humans. The algorithms described in this book play a major role in this paradigm shift and they include, for example, extraction of photogrammetric DEMs from drone's data, advanced drainage structure calculations, fuzzy process-based modelling and spatial topographic threshold computations, multicriteria analyses and expert-based systems development using analytic hierarchal processes, innovative data-mining and machine learning tools, autocorrelation and interpolation of soil health, physically-based soil evolution models, spatial decision support systems and many more. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Catchment Modeling; Gis And Remote Sensing; Modeling Soil Erosion; Quantifying Soil Movement; Soil Conservation Management; Soil Erosion Mapping; Soil Health Index; Water Erosion,,Book,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147847829

The pathogen is expanding its territory due to climate conditions, generating the need for early and accurate detection to avoid yield losses. In Germany, monitoring and control strategies are based on visual field assessments, with the parameter disease incidence (DI). This parameter triggers warning systems when a threshold is achieved, and decision-making takes place for fungicide application. However, visual scoring is a time-consuming activity that requires well-trained personnel and is the principal bottleneck for CLS control. Digital technologies can support this process. Thus, the present work is based on two trial fields conducted and monitored in 2020 using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a multispectral camera. Image data were collected in time series during the vegetation period. Trials were sown with different sugar beet varieties; for field management, there was employed diverse fungicide strategies, and artificial inoculation took place in a spot manner. Parallel to the flight mission and additional assessment of DI, disease severity (DS) via KWS scale was collected by experts as so-called ground truth (GT). Combined with image-processing, it was possible to catalogize plants in field trials, identify them over time, and use them for training and testing models. A convolutional neural network (CNN) supported by cataloged data was trained to perform classification of the disease presence in time-series, and performance was evaluated. As the last image processing step, maps were generated showing site-specific distribution of the diseased plants in the field. Generated maps can serve as a basis for application maps in practical cultivation or the evaluation of variety performance in variety trials. The presented methodological approach provides high precision and sensitivity in CLS detection and offers the potential to automate processes of CLS monitoring for different application areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cercospora Beticola; Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Incidence; Disease Severity,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133827108

It is a significant source of carbohydrates in African countries. Sometimes, Cassava crops can be infected by leaf diseases, affecting the overall production and reducing farmers’ income. The existing Cassava disease research encounters several challenges, such as poor detection rate, higher processing time, and poor accuracy. This research provides a comprehensive learning strategy for real-time Cassava leaf disease identification based on enhanced CNN models (ECNN). The existing Standard CNN model utilizes extensive data processing features, increasing the computational overhead. A depth-wise separable convolution layer is utilized to resolve CNN issues in the proposed ECNN model. This feature minimizes the feature count and computational overhead. The proposed ECNN model utilizes a distinct block processing feature to process the imbalanced images. To resolve the color segregation issue, the proposed ECNN model uses a Gamma correction feature. To decrease the variable selection process and increase the computational efficiency, the proposed ECNN model uses global average election polling with batch normalization. An experimental analysis is performed over an online Cassava image dataset containing 6256 images of Cassava leaves with five disease classes. The dataset classes are as follows: Class 0: “Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)”; class 1: “Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)”; class 2: “Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)”; class 3: “Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)”; and class 4: “Healthy”. Various performance measuring parameters, i.e., precision, recall, measure, and accuracy, are calculated for existing Standard CNN and the proposed ECNN model. The proposed ECNN classifier significantly outperforms and achieves 99.3% accuracy for the balanced dataset. The test findings prove that applying a balanced database of images improves classification performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cassava Leaf Disease Identification; Convolutional Neural Network Model; Deep Neural Network; Ecnn; Global Average Election Polling Layer,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125996691

However, how host factors regulate LLPS of viral proteins during negative-sense RNA (NSR) virus infection is largely unknown. Here, we used barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV) as a model to demonstrate regulation of host casein kinase 1 (CK1) in phase separation and infection of NSR viruses. We first found that the BYSMV phosphoprotein (P) formed spherical granules with liquid properties and recruited viral nucleotide (N) and polymerase (L) proteins in vivo. Moreover, the P-formed granules were tethered to the ER/actin network for trafficking and fusion. BYSMV P alone formed droplets and incorporated the N protein and the 5′ trailer of genomic RNA in vitro. Interestingly, phase separation of BYSMV P was inhibited by host CK1-dependent phosphor-ylation of an intrinsically disordered P protein region. Genetic assays demonstrated that the unphos-phorylated mutant of BYSMV P exhibited condensed phase, which promoted viroplasm formation and virus replication. Whereas, the phosphorylation-mimic mutant existed in diffuse phase state for virus transcription. Collectively, our results demonstrate that host CK1 modulates phase separation of the viral P protein and virus infection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Actins; Casein Kinase I; Intrinsically Disordered Proteins; Phosphoproteins; Viral Proteins; Casein Kinase I; Recombinant Protein; Virus Phosphoprotein; Actin; Intrinsically Disordered Protein; Phosphoprotein; Viral Protein; Agrobacterium Tumefaciens; Article; Barley; Chemoluminescence; Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy; Expression Vector; Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching; Host; Image Processing; Immunoelectron Microscopy; In Vitro Study; Maize; Nicotiana Benthamiana; Nonhuman; Open Reading Frame; Plasmid; Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Phosphorylation; Protein Purification; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rhabdoviridae; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Virus Infection; Virus Replication; Western Blotting; Metabolism; Phosphorylation; Physiology; Plant Disease; Rhabdovirus Infection; Virology; Actins; Casein Kinase I; Intrinsically Disordered Proteins; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Plant Diseases; Rhabdoviridae Infections; Viral Proteins; Virus Replication,casein kinase I; recombinant protein; virus phosphoprotein; actin; intrinsically disordered protein; phosphoprotein; viral protein; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Article; barley; chemoluminescence; confocal laser scanning microscopy; expression vector; fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; host; image processing; immunoelectron microscopy; in vitro study; maize; Nicotiana benthamiana; nonhuman; open reading frame; plasmid; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; polymerase chain reaction; protein phosphorylation; protein purification; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Rhabdoviridae; transmission electron microscopy; virus infection; virus replication; Western blotting; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology; plant disease; rhabdovirus infection; virology; Actins; Casein Kinase I; Intrinsically Disordered Proteins; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Plant Diseases; Rhabdoviridae Infections; Viral Proteins; Virus Replication,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125554231

These eukaryotic filamentous pathogens secrete effector proteins to facilitate plant infection. Fungi and oomycete pathogens have diverse infection strategies and their effectors generally do not share sequence homology. However, they occupy similar host environments, either the plant apoplast or plant cytoplasm, and, therefore, may share some unifying properties based on the requirements of these host compartments. Here, we exploit these biological signals and present the first classifier (EffectorP 3.0) that uses two machine-learning models: one trained on apoplastic effectors and one trained on cytoplasmic effectors. EffectorP 3.0 accurately predicts known apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors in fungal and oomycete secretomes with low estimated false-positive rates of 3 and 8%, respectively. Cytoplasmic effectors have a higher proportion of positively charged amino acids, whereas apoplastic effectors are enriched for cysteine residues. The combination of fungal and oomycete effectors in training leads to a higher number of predicted cytoplasmic effectors in biotrophic fungi. EffectorP 3.0 expands predicted effector repertoires beyond small, cysteine-rich secreted proteins in fungi and RxLR-motif containing secreted proteins in oomycetes. We show that signal peptide prediction is essential for accurate effector prediction, because EffectorP 3.0 recognizes a cytoplasmic signal also in intracellular, nonsecreted proteins. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fungus–plant Interactions; Oomycete–plant Interactions; Fungal Proteins; Fungal Protein; Cytoplasm; Fungus; Metabolism; Microbiology; Oomycetes; Plant; Plant Disease; Cytoplasm; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Plant Diseases; Plants,fungal protein; cytoplasm; fungus; metabolism; microbiology; Oomycetes; plant; plant disease; Cytoplasm; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Plant Diseases; Plants,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124794564

Plants evolved an array of adaptive strategies that perceive stress stimuli and respond to these stress signals through specific mechanisms. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a premier signal for plants to respond to drought and plays a critical role in plant growth and development. ABA triggers a variety of physiological processes such as stomatal closure, root system modulation, organizing soil microbial communities, activation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression, and metabolic alterations. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of ABA-mediated drought responses in plants is critical for ensuring crop yield and global food security. In this review, we highlighted how plants adjust ABA perception, transcriptional levels of ABA- and drought-related genes, and regulation of metabolic pathways to alter drought stress responses at both cellular and the whole plant level.

However, the organic fertilization of no-till soils may sustain subtropical agroecosystems for only a limited period until the soil quality declines. The C, N, P, and other nutrient cycles are perturbed due to the nutrient imbalance in manures and their application on the soil surface, which poses a risk for nutrient dispersion into the environment. Long-term N-based manure application also impacts the apparent nutrient recovery (ANR) by crops and, hence, the crop quality. Our objective was to monitor changes in soil quality and to measure nutrient recovery from N-based organic fertilization in a Brazilian agroecosystem. A long-term experiment was established in May 2004 on Typic Hapludalf soil in Southern Brazil. The experiment comprised two periods: 2004–2009 and 2009–2020. The treatments were unfertilized (control), pig slurry, pig deep litter (swine manure and rice husk), cattle slurry, and mineral fertilizer (urea, triple superphosphate, and K chloride). Grain and cover crops were grown. The maize grain yield and oat biomass were used as indicators of productivity. The application of cattle slurry, pig deep litter, and pig slurry increased the grain production by 20% on average compared to mineral fertilization. Organic manuring increased the soil pH by up to one unit, while urea acidified the soil. The highest crop yields were obtained with pig deep litter, which increased the levels of P, K, Ca, Mg, and C in the soil test. Pig deep litter showed the highest N-ANR for the aboveground part of the plants. The ANRs for P, K, Ca, and Mg were also highest when pig slurry had been applied. The ANR values for the micronutrients varied widely among the organic sources but indicated large marginal offtake gains compared to mineral fertilization. The N-based fertilization with animal manures increased the rate of nutrient uptake by plants but led to an accumulation of nutrients in the soil, threatening the sustainability of the system. Manure applications must be monitored regularly to avoid the accumulation of nutrients that could impair the soil quality and become an environmental problem in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Yield; Long-term Experiments; Machine-learning Methods; Organic Waste; Soil Nutrient,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123170111

Such crop areas come from land cover maps or reported statistics, both of which can have errors and uncertainties. Sub-national or regional crop yield forecasting minimizes the propagation of these errors to some extent. In addition, regional forecasts provide added value and insights to stakeholders on regional differences within a country, which would otherwise compensate each other at national level. We propose a crop yield forecasting approach for multiple spatial levels based on regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning. Machine learning, with its data-driven approach, can leverage larger data sizes and capture nonlinear relationships between predictors and yield at regional level. We designed a generic machine learning workflow to demonstrate the benefits of regional crop yield forecasting in Europe. To evaluate the quality and usefulness of regional forecasts, we predicted crop yields for 35 case studies, including nine countries that are major producers of six crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, grain maize, sugar beets and potatoes). Machine learning models at regional level had lower normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE) and uncertainty than a linear trend model, with Wilcoxon p-values of 3e-7 and 2e-7 for 60 days before harvest and end of season respectively. Similarly, regional machine learning forecasts aggregated to national level had lower NRMSEs than forecasts from an operational system in 18 out of 35 cases 60 days before harvest, with a Wilcoxon p-value of 0.95 indicating similar performance. Our models have room for improvement, especially during extreme years. Nevertheless, regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning and aggregated national forecasts provide a consistent forecasting method across spatial levels and insights from regional differences to support important policy decisions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Yield; Large-scale Crop Yield Forecasting; Machine Learning; Regional Differences; Scalability; Agricultural Policy; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Forecasting Method; Harvesting; Land Cover; Machine Learning; Stakeholder; Europe; Helianthus; Hordeum; Solanum Tuberosum,agricultural policy; crop production; crop yield; forecasting method; harvesting; land cover; machine learning; stakeholder; Europe; Helianthus; Hordeum; Solanum tuberosum,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120472536

Sugarcane crop attributes were retrieved from high-resolution (30 m) satellite imageries to develop yield prediction models. The feed-forward back-propagation neural network algorithm developed and calibrated using the remote sensing retrieved crop parameters and ground truth data in MATLAB environment. The perceptron was trained with 75 out of the 100 possible inputs upto10,000 epochs with 1–10 hidden neurons. Four performance indices: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and the average ratio of estimated yield to target crop yield (R<inf>ratio</inf>) were calculated, to achieve optimum neural network. Several runs were performed in determining the optimum number of hidden neurons. The best performance of the models was observed at i + 1 and i + 2 hidden nodes (i = No of input parameters). The range of R2 values of best performed models were between 0.867 and 0.916 for training and same for testing it ranged from 0.829 to 0.991 and R<inf>ratio</inf> values from 0.997 to 1.006, the normalized RMSE values ranged from 0.066 to 0.150; MAE ranged from 0.034 to 0.119 for training and 0.017–0.184 for testing. The statistical analysis recommends the reliability of the ANN model in sugarcane yield estimation. Multivariate linear regression was also performed for training and testing data separately to test the superiority of the ANN model.

Literature survey shows that the image recognition and integrated deep learning approach is successfully employed for Cassava leaf disease classification. Mostly, transfer learning based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) models were successfully applied for Cassava leaf disease classification. However, existing approaches are not effective in identifying the tiny portion of the disease in the overall leaf area. Identifying and focussing on regions affected by the disease is vital to achieving a good classification accuracy. An attention-based approach is integrated into pretrained CNN-based EfficientNet models to locate and identify the tiny infected regions in Cassava leaf. Penultimate layer features of attention-based EfficientNet models such as A_EfficientNetB4, A_EfficientNetB5, and A_EfficientNetB6 were extracted. Next, the dimensionality of the extracted features was reduced using kernel principal component analysis. The reduced features were fused and passed into a stacked ensemble meta-classifier for Cassava leaf disease classification. A stacked ensemble meta-classifier is a two-stage approach in which the first stage employs random forest and support vector machine (SVM) for prediction followed by logistic regression for classification. Detailed investigation and analysis of the proposed method, attention, and non-attention-based approaches with CNN pretrained models were tested using a publicly available benchmark dataset of Cassava leaf disease images. The proposed method achieved better performances in all experiments than several existing methods as well as various attention and non-attention-based CNN pretrained models. The proposed approach can be used as a deployable tool for Cassava leaf disease classification in agricultural field. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Robots; Classification (of Information); Convolutional Neural Networks; Decision Trees; Deep Learning; Image Recognition; Logistic Regression; Principal Component Analysis; Support Vector Machines; Transfer Learning; Viruses; Attention; Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Classification; Features Fusions; Large-scale Learning; Leaf Disease; Meta-classifiers; Stacked Classifier; Plants (botany),Agricultural robots; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Deep learning; Image recognition; Logistic regression; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Transfer learning; Viruses; Attention; Convolutional neural network; Disease classification; Features fusions; Large-scale learning; Leaf disease; Meta-classifiers; Stacked classifier; Plants (botany),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118496654

Therefore, it is necessary to determine the outbreak, severity, and progress of the disease and pest in a timely and accurate manner. There is a need for faster and practical innovative methods that reduce human errors in the identification of plant diseases, disease severity, and progress of the disease, especially in wide production areas. Agricultural applications of drones have increased significantly in recent years because of their greater availability and the miniaturization of hardware such as GPS, sensors, cameras, inertial measurement units, etc. Drones mounted with camera are a cost-effective option for capturing images covering areas with disease and pest. However, visual inspection of such images can be a challenging and biased task, specifically for diseases and pests detecting.

India's most promising and widely cultivated crop is sugarcane. It can be planted as a cash crop or a major crop. Sugarcane is harvested by small to medium-sized peasant for the production of brown sugar used for feeding animals. Sugarcane complexes are used in the sugarcane business to make white sugar, bio-electricity, bio-ethanol, and many more organic products. To keep up with the world's rising population, sugarcane yields must be increased. Pests and illnesses have a significant impact on sugarcane productivity. As a result, both farmers and the country incur significant economic losses. As a result, early detection of numerous sugarcane diseases and pest management strategies are required to boost productivity. The inability to identify sugarcane leaf diseases with the bare eye leads to flawed insecticide regulator measurements. To boost productivity and quality, an automatic detection and early diagnosis of sugarcane illnesses is required. Algorithms used in processing of images extract features from sugarcane leaves rapidly and identify ailment types at an initial stage. This study presents a survey of several image processing techniques and deep learning approaches for sugarcane diagnosis extraction and rapid assessment. The challenges that underpin computational approaches for assessing sugarcane infections are also highlighted, as well as possible future possibilities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Classifying; Computational Model; Feature Extraction; Plant Illnesses; Sugarcane; Computational Methods; Crops; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Extraction; Losses; Plants (botany); Cash Crops; Classifying; Computational Modelling; Cultivated Crops; Disease Detection; Economic Growths; Features Extraction; Four-quadrant; Plant Illness; Sugarcane; Feature Extraction,Computational methods; Crops; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Extraction; Losses; Plants (botany); Cash crops; Classifying; Computational modelling; Cultivated crops; Disease detection; Economic growths; Features extraction; Four-quadrant; Plant illness; Sugarcane; Feature extraction,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85154534701

The pH level of the soil, the water content of the crops, humidity, and micro- and macronutrients are all important for good crop growth. If any of these conditions are not met, crop growth may become unbalanced. Machine learning approaches can help with both prediction and categorization difficulties. The Crop Internet of Things (CIoT) is primarily used to monitor crop productivity and health on farmland. CIoT aids in the monitoring of humidity, soil pH, moisture content, type and quality of soil required for a given crop, and fertiliser type and content. Various sensors, such as humidity sensors, pH sensors, soil quality sensors, and temperature sensors, can be utilised to detect crop yields, as well as machine learning approaches for predicting crop yields while using descriptive analytics. Farmers will profit immensely from an early forecast of soil status using machine learning in the agricultural scenario in order to create a better environment for future agriculture. In the suggested work, we collect historical data and current live datasets from sensor data, and then we pass it via the preprocessing stage, where we perform and attempt to filter out irrelevant or missing data. It has been passed to the testing and training phase after the preprocessing stage has been completed. The data from this phase is subsequently passed to the analytic phase, where it is stored in the database using Spark. The model is trained using machine learning techniques, which will assist in making correct soil content and weed control decisions. Machine learning algorithms with multi-object parameters can be utilised to achieve accurate results by merging different crop-related characteristics. Big data paired with machine learning can help detect and control weeds and enhance performance.

However, artificial intelligence related technologies are widely used in agriculture, especially in plant disease identification and fruit quality detection. In this paper, digipathos, the public data of plant pathology provided by EMBRAPA, is used as the research object, and a method for identifying different plant diseases based on Siamese Networks and image processing is proposed. The experiment uses 9 crop categories and 50 corresponding disease categories, a total of 33567 pictures as the training set, and the experimental evaluation uses a total of 3356 pictures as the verification set, with a recognition accuracy of 80.6%, The effectiveness of this method in plant disease identification is verified, which is of great significance to improve agricultural products and ensure the green and sustainable development of agricultural ecological environment.

The insufficient yield and low nutritional value of the crops are due to the numerous ambient stresses. Which has challenged the nutritional security of people in developing and underdeveloped nations that are already been malnourished. The tremendously changing global climate and the ever-increasing world population are the principal apprehensions guiding towards the adaptation of a neoteric technique that can aid in achieving the sustainable development of agriculture with enriched nutritional value, plant resilience, and improved yield potential. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein-based genome-editing (CRISPR-Cas) tool is the most valuable technique to boon the modern world and offers an edge over to meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) by being its tremendous potency, accuracy, ease of use, and versatility. Here, we have highlighted the neoteric advancements of the CRISPR-Cas-based approaches that have revolutionized the way of food production in the agriculture industry. It has paved the way for food security by modifying crucial crop attributes by introducing desirable characteristics that employ knockout and/or knockin of targeted genes to generate resistant crop plants with enriched nutritional quality, yield enhancement, and stress resilience. In addition, we have also shed light on different mechanisms, challenges, approaches for the minimization of off-target effects, and future possibilities of these neoteric genome-editing tools. Furthermore, with the advent of the CRISPR-based platform, the numerous emerging biotechnologies have broadened the basic crop research toolbox and synthetic biotechnology via the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and various bioinformatics frameworks. Eventually, the current global regulatory stratagems and social approval of CRISPR-Cas-based crop trait enhancement have been explored. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Crispr-cas; Genome Editing; Nutrition; Stress Resilience,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150510760

Cassava is a second most provider of carbohydrates in Africa. It is a key food for people of Africa in very harsh conditions. According to United Nations (FAO) almost eighty percent farmers of sub Saharan Africa are growing cassava roots, but due to a variety of viral diseases the production of cassava is very low from last two years. With the help of data science, it is possible to diagnose and classify these types of viral diseases. Existing methods of disease detection require farmers to solicit the help of government-funded agricultural experts to visually inspect and diagnose the plants. Moreover, this process is labor-intensive, time taken, costly and impacting the production and supply cycle. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth. The dataset which we use in this research is taken from Kaggle competition 2020. Dataset contains 21397 images of cassava plants which belongs to five different classes i.e., Cassava Bacterial Blight, Cassava Brown Streak Disease, Cassava Green Mottle, Cassava Mosaic Disease and Healthy leaves. In this work we have used augmentation technique to increase the samples for classification and balancing the uneven distribution of data for all classes and used deep learning model efficiennetB3 for identification classification of diseases and got 83.03% overall accuracy on test dataset with more than 90% individual accuracy of each class.

As a result, farmers rely on accurate weather forecasts to run their businesses. Agriculture is interwoven with other industries, including the sugar industry, which relies on sugarcane farmers. They may be able to better organise their logistics by employing machine learning or artificial intelligence to estimate agricultural production. As a result, both AI and connected IoT devices have a lot of potential in agriculture. When estimating agricultural yields, there are various elements to consider. Weather trends, satellite images, soil quality, and the potential of an infestation are all investigated in this location. When all of these criteria are taken into account, a complete picture of when crops should be planted emerges. In the event that unanticipated problems develop, there are also 'what-if' scenarios and backup plans in place. Climate change can affect agricultural production in a variety of ways, including changes in average temperatures, precipitation amounts, heat waves, CO2 levels in the air, and ozone levels at ground level. Climate change has a wide range of affects from country to country. Lower-elevation countries are more prone to have difficulties producing crops. Equipment capable of accurately predicting the evolution of weather patterns is required Weather forecasts based on statistics look at previous data to see if there are any patterns between seasons. As a result, the winter data can be used to forecast summer temperatures. Winter temperatures will almost probably alter if summer temperatures change. In the published literature, researchers have detailed their confirmed solutions to various problems. If prior concepts are used without first receiving a qualified review, future researchers will not get the desired results. If the researchers don't first undertake a thorough investigation of the most recent indications of performance, it's likely that they won't be able to find evidence of future growth in the direction of excellence.

The seed of the grass species Oryza sativa is commonly identified as rice. Rice is consumed all over the world as a main source of carbohydrate, specially in Asian countries. As a South Asian country, our homeland Bangladesh has identified rice as its staple food. Throughout the world, rice leaf diseases cause a huge loss in rice production each year. Traditionally, rice leaf diseases are detected in laboratory tests, which is time consuming. If machine learning and computer vision based approaches-which are faster and more accurate comparing to manual detection of rice leaf diseases- can be implemented to detect rice diseases, a substantial amount of production loss pertaining to these diseases can be mitigated. Deep learning frameworks, such as, convolutional neural networks (CNN) shows higher efficacy in image classification and object detection from images. They can be utilized to classify various rice diseases and, as a result, can play an important role in early detection of rice diseases and, consequently, improving the production. In this paper, we have utilized transfer learning approach by using three pretrained CNN models: InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNet V2S to detect five prominent diseases of rice (Oryza Sativa) leaves along with healthy leaves seen in our country and have demonstrated extensive comparison between these models. Among the models, DenseNet201 showcased the highest accuracy which was 92.05%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Image Classification; Oryza Sativa; Pretrained; Rice Leaf Dis-ease; Transfer Learning; Computer Vision; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Learning Systems; Neural Network Models; Object Detection; Plants (botany); Transfer Learning; Convolutional Neural Network; Images Classification; Leaf Disease; Learning Approach; Oryza Sativa; Pretrained; Rice (oryza Sativa); Rice Leaf Dis-ease; Rice Leaves; Image Classification,Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning systems; Neural network models; Object detection; Plants (botany); Transfer learning; Convolutional neural network; Images classification; Leaf disease; Learning approach; Oryza sativa; Pretrained; Rice (oryza sativa); Rice leaf dis-ease; Rice leaves; Image classification,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142288241

Cassava leaves are also very useful and rich in vitamins and protein. Cassava hay is widely used as animal feed and in textile industries. The cassava leaves are infected by diseases that affect the productivity of the crop, and hence the livelihood of the farmers is affected. To handle this, an automatic system is needed to detect the diseases found in the cassava leaves. In this work, we aim to address this problem by automatically identifying the diseases in an early stage itself by applying suitable image processing techniques. A deep learning architecture is proposed that predicts leaf diseases of cassava using a pretrained network that employs CNN architecture. To improve the performance of the proposed system, the data is augmented using a CutMix algorithm. Seven different transfer learning-based deep learning architectures such as VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, Inception, Xception and EfficientNet were explored to identify a suitable classifier for the Kaggle dataset of Cassava leaves for disease classification. Further, the two platforms for computationally intensive applications namely GPU and TPU were explored in this proposed work. Having observed that only around 8, 000 parameters-that is, 0.05% out of 17 million parameters-were trained in the transfer learning model using GPU during training, and motivated us to transition to TPU-based computation. The trainable parameters have been increased up to 99.3 percent by shifting the computational platform from GPU to TPU to experience better performance in classification. The classification accuracy has shown a positive shift of 7 percent due to this transition. From the experimental results on the Cassava leaves dataset, it is observed that EfficientNet architecture performs best with an accuracy of 88.41 percent, which is a significant improvement over the other techniques. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141092168

Lime is rich 10 source of vitamin C which works as an immunity booster in human body. Because of the late and manually diseases detection in lime causes a vast loss in crop production worldwide. The most common diseases are found in limes are lime canker, lemon scab, brown rot, sooty mould and Armillaria. In this paper we used imaging and non-imaging (spectral based sensing) methods with the combination of machine learning technique to detect the lime canker and sooty mould diseases. Image acquirement, pre-processing, segmentation and classification are all steps in the imaging methodology, which is then followed by feature extraction. In non-imaging methodology a multispectral sensor (Spectrometer) is used with 400 nm to 1000 nm wavelength to detect the diseases. training set and test set ratio is fixed for both techniques are 75% and 25% respectively.

It has an influence not only on the economics of the country but also on global food grain statistics. Food security is a major challenge due to the rapidly increasing global people as well as the reducing trend in yields of crops. Obtaining sustainable crop production is always a problem for agriculturists. Due to ever-changing climatic circumstances, achieving optimal agricultural output has always been a problem for farmers. Land types, resource availability, and fluctuating climate patterns are the main causes of agricultural production uncertainty. Thus, researchers are developing tools that can predict crop production correctly and effectively in advance, allowing farmers worldwide to act accordingly in strategies to respond to obstacles. Agronomic strategies used by farmers at various phases of crop production and meteorological elements have a significant impact on crop production output [5]. The supply of nutrients directly impacts crops and the production of crops. Crops require a variety of nutrients, which are branched into two groups based on their requirements: macroeconomic nutrients and essential micronutrients. Phosphorous (P), Nitrogen (N), Calcium (Ca), Zinc (Zn), Potassium (K), Boron (B), Iron (Fe),Magnesium (Mg), Sulphur (S), and other nutrients are among them. Many micronutrients in the crops regulate biochemical processes, give resistance to diseases, and ultimately degrade crop quality. As a result, regulated nutrient management is critical for increasing crop production and achieving the essential rise in output. Furthermore, minerals have an important function in soil fertility, making it more productive for crop development. The following review article is going to address the most current facts regarding nutrients along with their usage in agricultural production for crop development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Yield; Machine Learning; Precise Agriculture; Soil Nutrients; Supervised Learning; Cultivation; Food Supply; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Nutrients; Precision Agriculture; Trace Elements; Agricultural Productions; Agriculture Productions; Crop Development; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Machine-learning; Precise Agriculture; Precision Agriculture; Precision Machines; Soil Nutrients; Crops,Cultivation; Food supply; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nutrients; Precision agriculture; Trace elements; Agricultural productions; Agriculture productions; Crop development; Crop production; Crop yield; Machine-learning; Precise agriculture; Precision Agriculture; Precision machines; Soil nutrients; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137802494

Throughout this work, weed images were trained using the proposed CNN model with evolutionary computing approach to classify the weeds based on the two publicly available weed datasets. The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) dataset used as a first dataset that consists of 40 classes of weed images and the other dataset is from Indian Council of Agriculture Research – Directorate of Weed Research (ICAR-DWR) which contains 50 classes of weed images. An effective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is applied in the proposed CNN to automatically evolve and improve its classification accuracy.

Plant innate immunity relies on a broad repertoire of receptor proteins that can detect pathogens and trigger an effective defense response. Bioinformatic tools based on conserved domain and sequence similarity are within the most popular strategies for protein identification and characterization. However, the multi-domain nature, high sequence diversity and complex evolutionary history of disease resistance (DR) proteins make their prediction a real challenge. Here we present RFPDR, which pioneers the application of Random Forest (RF) for Plant DR protein prediction. Methods. A recently published collection of experimentally validated DR proteins was used as a positive dataset, while 10x10 nested datasets, ranging from 400-4,000 non-DR proteins, were used as negative datasets. A total of 9,631 features were extracted from each protein sequence, and included in a full dimension (FD) RFPDR model. Sequence selection was performed, to generate a reduced-dimension (RD) RFPDR model. Model performances were evaluated using an 80/20 (training/testing) partition, with 10- cross fold validation, and compared to baseline, sequence-based and state-of-the-art strategies. To gain some insights into the underlying biology, the most discriminatory sequence-based features in the RF classifier were identified. Results and Discussion. RD-RFPDR showed to be sensitive (86.4 ± 4.0%) and specific (96.9 ± 1.5%) for identifying DR proteins, while robust to data imbalance. Its high performance and robustness, added to the fact that RD-RFPDR provides valuable information related to DR proteins underlying properties, make RD-RFPDR an interesting approach for DR protein prediction, complementing the state-of-the-art strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Defense Response; Disease Resistance; Machine Learning; Plant Immunity; Random Forest; Plant Disease Resistance Protein; Plant Protein; Proteome; Unclassified Drug; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Area Under The Curve; Article; Barley; Disease Resistance; Feature Extraction; Japonica Rice; Machine Learning; Measurement Accuracy; Measurement Precision; Nonhuman; Plant Disease; Plant Immunity; Prediction; Random Forest; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Sensitivity And Specificity; Soybean; Tomato; Triticum Aestivum,plant disease resistance protein; plant protein; proteome; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis thaliana; area under the curve; Article; barley; disease resistance; feature extraction; Japonica rice; machine learning; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; nonhuman; plant disease; plant immunity; prediction; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; soybean; tomato; Triticum aestivum,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130743101

Lack of care for such crops results in causing serious ailments on plants and it is very important for identifying disease in plants for an efficient crop yield. Maladies on the plant causes depletion in both the quantity and quality of the crop. This paper possesses a real-time, precise, and efficient approach based on machine learning to recognize maladies existing in a tomato plant by revealing from its leaves. The model for disease detection was trained on plant leaves which were taken from PlantVillage Dataset and a convolution neural network-based algorithm was used for the identification of maladies in tomato plant leaf.

Sugarcane cultivation is the most organized division of farming. Due to the favorable conditions for its growth, it is the first choice of cultivation for farmers. It is directly linked to the sugar industry and plays a major role in the economy of several countries, like Brazil, India, China, and so on. Sugarcane crop holds the largest production value among all the commercially grown crops. Contradictorily, there are multifarious diseases that affect the crop in yield and quality. Some of these are detected by farmers when they visually inspect the leaves. However, most of the diseases go undetected leading to huge losses to farmers. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the type of infestation to aid in controlling its damage. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning neural network architecture in which the type of disease afflicting the sugarcane crop is predicted by training the model on images of affected leaves. The following diseases are detected: rust spots, yellow leaf disease, Helmanthospura leaf spot, Cercospora leaf spot, and red rot. The approach involves a convolutional neural network that is trained as an image classifier with around 3000 leaf images. The model is tested for about 1000 images. The proposed model has achieved 96% accuracy. An Android application is developed as a user interface for this model. Using this application, farmers can capture the images through a phone camera or select images from the gallery. In the server, the image is fed to the model, which will process the image and predict the disease. This prediction will be displayed on the farmer’s phone in the application, so that they can take the necessary precautionary measures to mitigate losses. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Android Application; Cercospora Leaf Spot; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Helmanthospura Leaf Spot; Plant Disease Detection; Red Rot; Rust Spots; Sugarcane Disease Detection; Yellow Leaf Disease,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129847808

Plant diseases are a huge problem in agriculture and incorporating machine learning algorithms for their early detection will help better yields and save the farmers from loses. This paper entails the use of such machine learning algorithms to detect leaf diseases in the cassava plant. Cassava is one of the largest sources of carbohydrates for the continent of Africa. It is also very vulnerable to several plant diseases; this in turn threatens the food security of the continent. The present study is based on four of such diseases that affect the cassava yield namely, Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), and Cassava Green Mottle (CGM). In this research work, EfficientNet-B0 is proposed for the early detection of these diseases. The EfficientNet-B0 models outperform existing CNNs in terms of accuracy and efficiency while reducing parameter size and FLOPS by an order of magnitude. It is easier to detect disease at an early stage without the assistance of professionals, saving farmers both time and money.

Growing plants at home have become a hobby as well as a nutrient factor. It also ensures that the vegetables and plants are pesticide-free and contain nutrients like antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals as a whole. But growing plants at home is not that easy as they get affected by different diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses which raise the need to identify them to prevent them from causing health issues to humans. This paper identifies the common diseases that affect vegetables like affect tomatoes, potatoes, corn, pepper leaves by using an android mobile application which is generally diagnosed by human visual confirmation. The Application allows gardeners to input the image of the diseased plant. The image is then converted and processed with the trained model against the common symptoms include water-soaked, gray-green spots, and dark circular spots. This process will be done by using a dataset which is a collection of all infected leaves images that will be processed through an image processing and train it by using CNN that extracts and learn the features. This project aims to help house-gardeners identify plant leaf diseases to ensure their health, raise the productivity and quality of plants. Deep learning is introduced to tackle this problem to raise the quality and quantity of plant production and to ensure public health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Diseases Detection; Machine Learning; Plant Diseases,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129194491

The disease on the plant causes severe suffering to farmers economically. So, the plant disease is either to be controlled or predicted before it leads to big damages. To solve this issue, machine learning algorithms have been proposed to analyze the root causes of the disease and to prescribe suitable pesticides to cure the plant. Though many methods have been encountered to detect the disease of a crop, the existing methods failed to give accurate results. While many existing methods failed to apply image processing techniques and databases to store the crop data, the proposed CNN algorithm adopted these features by creating web applications to know the different types of disease that have occurred on the plant. The result witnesses that the proposed algorithms have shown improved accuracy (93.3%) which helps the farmer to raise the productivity of a crop. The developed app also helps young farmers to read and select suitable image options to improve the good yielding of their agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Detection; Machine Learning; Pattern Recognition; Plant Leaf Diseases; Convolutional Neural Networks; Image Enhancement; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Pattern Recognition; Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Detection; Human Being; Image Processing Technique; Leaf Disease; Machine Learning Algorithms; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf Disease; Plant Leaves; Root Cause; Crops,Convolutional neural networks; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Human being; Image processing technique; Leaf disease; Machine learning algorithms; Plant disease; Plant leaf disease; Plant leaves; Root cause; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127338831

Good crop management practices lead to good yield. There is some observation required for monitoring crop growth in different growth stages such as canopy height, and root depth. Traditionally, canopy height is measured manually. This method is low, labor-intensive, and lacks accuracy. IoT and wireless sensor networks help to monitor crop growth in different stages. Canopy height has been used to predict yield, fertilizer application in the crop, water requirement, or biomass. The ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves to the plant area. The sound waves are reflected from the plant and absorb by the receiver. The time difference between emitting and absorb was calculated to measure the canopy height and transfer the data to the server using IoT and wireless sensor network architecture. Canopy height is highly correlated with root depth. Using artificial intelligence (AI) technics, easy to estimate root depth. Root depth information helps in irrigation scheduling. During photosynthesis, the crop converts carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, this cycle is known as the Calvin cycle. Depend on canopy height, Calvin cycle will varieties. So canopy height is directly related to crop yield. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Canopy Height; Iot; Linear Regression; Root Depth Estimation; Ultrasonic Sensor; Wireless Sensor Network; Carbon Dioxide; Crops; Internet Of Things; Network Architecture; Ultrasonic Sensors; Calvin Cycle; Canopy Heights; Crop Growth; Crop Management Practices; Depth Estimation; Different Growth Stages; Height Measurement; Labour-intensive; Low-yield; Root Depth Estimation; Wireless Sensor Networks,Carbon dioxide; Crops; Internet of things; Network architecture; Ultrasonic sensors; Calvin cycle; Canopy heights; Crop growth; Crop management practices; Depth Estimation; Different growth stages; Height Measurement; Labour-intensive; Low-yield; Root depth estimation; Wireless sensor networks,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127141485

The fact is that manually diagnosing diseases is time consuming and that the effectiveness of the diagnosis is related to the pathologist's talents, making this a great application area for computer-aided diagnostic systems. The proposed work describes an approach for detecting and classifying diseases in citrus plants using deep learning and image processing. The main cause of decreased productivity is considered to be plant diseases, which results in financial losses. Citrus is an important source of nutrients such as vitamin C all around the world. On the contrary, citrus diseases have a negative impact on the citrus fruit and quality. In the recent decade, computer vision and image processing techniques have become increasingly popular for the detection and classification of plant diseases. The suggested approach is evaluated on the citrus disease image gallery dataset and the combined dataset (citrus image datasets of infested scale and plant village). These datasets were used to identify and classify citrus diseases such as anthracnose, black spot, canker, scab, greening, and melanose. AlexNet and VGG19 are two kinds of convolutional neural networks that were used to build and test the proposed approach. The system's total performance reached 94% at its best.

Moreover, after applying each architecture separately, we compared their obtained results to find out the best architecture configuration for classifying bean leaf diseases and their results. Furthermore, to satisfy the classification requirements, the model was trained using MobileNetV2 architecture under the some controlled conditions as MobileNet to check if we could get faster training times, higher accuracy and easier retraining, we evaluated and implemented MobileNet architectures on one public dataset including two unhealthy classes (angular leaf spot disease and bean rust disease) and one healthy class, the algorithm was tested on 1296 images of bean leaf. The obtained results showed that our MobileNet model achieves high classification performance for beans leaf disease, the classification average accuracy of the proposed model is more than 97% on training dataset and more than 92% on test data for two unhealthy classes and one healthy class. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computer Architecture; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Data Models; Deep Learning; Diseases; Training; Classification (of Information); Deep Learning; Network Architecture; Neural Networks; Seed; Statistical Tests; Angular Leaf Spot Disease; Bean Leaf; Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Classification; Leaf Disease; Mobilenet; Rust Disease; Tensorflow; Computer Architecture,Classification (of information); Deep learning; Network architecture; Neural networks; Seed; Statistical tests; Angular leaf spot disease; Bean leaf; Convolutional neural network; Disease classification; Leaf disease; Mobilenet; Rust disease; Tensorflow; Computer architecture,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123312013

Most of the variation in yield is attributed to environmental factors such as climate conditions, soil type and cultivation practices. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and random forest regression (RFR) are machine learning tools that are used unambiguously for crop yield prediction. There is limited research regarding the application of these mathematical models for the prediction of rapeseed yield and quality. A four-year study (2015–2018) was carried out in the Republic of Serbia with 40 winter rapeseed genotypes. The field trial was designed as a randomized complete block design in three replications. ANN, based on the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno iterative algorithm, and RFR models were used for prediction of seed yield, oil and protein yield, oil and protein content, and 1000 seed weight, based on the year of production and genotype. The best production year for rapeseed cultivation was 2016, when the highest seed and oil yield were achieved, 2994 kg/ha and 1402 kg/ha, respectively. The RFR model showed better prediction capabilities compared to the ANN model (the r2 values for prediction of output variables were 0.944, 0.935, 0.912, 0.886, 0.936 and 0.900, for oil and protein content, seed yield, 1000 seed weight, oil and protein yield, respectively). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Neural Network; Mathematical Modelling; Oil Content; Random Forest; Rapeseed; Yield,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122182340

As the LRR unit sequence is highly variable, accurately predicting the number and location of LRR units in proteins is a highly challenging task in the field of bioinformatics. Existing methods still need to be improved, especially when it comes to similarity‐based methods. We introduce our DeepLRR method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and LRR features to predict the number and location of LRR units in proteins. We compared DeepLRR with six existing methods using a dataset containing 572 LRR proteins and it outperformed all of them when it comes to overall F1 score. In addition, DeepLRR has integrated identifying plant disease-resistance proteins (NLR, LRR‐RLK, LRR‐RLP) and non‐canonical domains. With DeepLRR, 223, 191 and 183 LRR‐RLK genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa ssp. Japonica) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genomes were re‐annotated, respectively. Chromosome map-ping and gene cluster analysis revealed that 24.2% (54/223), 29.8% (57/191) and 16.9% (31/183) of LRR‐RLK genes formed gene cluster structures in Arabidopsis, rice and tomato, respectively. Fi-nally, we explored the evolutionary relationship and domain composition of LRR‐RLK genes in each plant and distributions of known receptor and co‐receptor pairs.

To attain a higher crop yield while preserving the environment, appropriate management of macronutrients (i.e., nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)) and crops are of critical prominence. This paper aims to review the state of art of the use of remote sensing in soil agricultural applications, especially in monitoring NPK availability for widely grown crops in Africa. In this study, we conducted a substantial literature review of the use of airborne imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing spectral information, and advances of these applications in farming practices by the African scientific community. Here we aimed to identify knowledge gaps in this field and challenges related to the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery for soil agriculture investigations. To do so, publications over the past 10 years (i.e., 2008–2021) in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in monitoring macronutrients status for crops were reviewed. In this study, the imaging platforms and sensors, as well as the different methods of processing encountered across the literature, were investigated and their benefit for NPK assessment were highlighted. Furthermore, we identified and selected particular spectral regions, bands, or features that are most sensitive to describe NPK content (both in crop and soil) that allowed to characterize NPK. In this review, we proposed a hyperspectral data-based research protocol to quantify variability of NPK in soil and crop at the field scale for the sake of optimizing fertilizers application. We believe that this review will contribute promoting the adoption of hyperspectral technology (i.e., imaging and spectroscopy) for the optimization of soil NPK investigation, mapping, and monitoring in many African countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Soils; Crop Yield; Fertigation; Hyperspectral Imaging; Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Variable Rate Fertilization; Agricultural Products; Hyperspectral Imaging; Machine Learning; Mapping; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Soils; Spectroscopy; Agricultural Land; Agricultural Soils; Crop Yield; Fertigations; Literature Reviews; Multi Sensor; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing Applications; Remote-sensing; Variable Rate Fertilization; Crops,Agricultural products; Hyperspectral imaging; Machine learning; Mapping; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Soils; Spectroscopy; Agricultural land; Agricultural soils; Crop yield; Fertigations; Literature reviews; Multi sensor; Precision Agriculture; Remote sensing applications; Remote-sensing; Variable rate fertilization; Crops,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121684769

There are three elements which are naturally available to the plant known as sunlight, air and water. For other elements plants entirely depend on soil minerals. Soil analysis is important to the farmer to know which type of crops can be cultivated in a particular soil characteristic condition. If a farmer knows which type of nutrients are in the soil like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K). Soil pH is also very important for a crop. It will help the farmer, to which type of crop can be yield. So a farmer can improve the productivity of the next crop.

In this paper, a robust disease detectionmethod is developed based on convolutional neural network (CNN), where its powerful features extraction capabilities are leveraged to detect diseases in images of fruits and leaves.

A novel dataset is collected from peach orchards and extensively augmented using both label-preserving and non-label-preserving transformations. The augmented dataset is used to study the effects of finetuning the pretrained networks' feature extraction pipeline as opposed to keeping the network parameters unchanged.

The mis-interpretations of plant diseases often lead to wrong pesticide selection, resulting in damage of crops. Hence, the automatic recognition of the diseases at earlier stages is important as well as economical for better quality and quantity of fruits. Computer aided detection (CAD) has proven as a supportive tool for disease detection and classification, thus allowing the identification of diseases and reducing the rate of degradation of fruit quality. In this research work, a model based on convolutional neural network with 19 convolutional layers has been proposed for effective and accurate classification of Marsonina Coronaria and Apple Scab diseases from apple leaves. For this, a database of 50,000 images has been acquired by collecting images of leaves from apple farms of Himachal Pradesh (H.P) and Uttarakhand (India). An augmentation technique has been performed on the dataset to increase the number of images for increasing the accuracy. The performance analysis of the proposed model has been compared with the new two ConvolutionalNeural Network (CNN) models having 8 and 9 layers respectively.

To achieve sustainable nitrogen fertilizer management for precision agriculture, there is an urgent need for nondestructive and high spatial resolution monitoring of crop nitrogen and its allocation to photosynthetic proteins as that changes over time. Here, we used visible to shortwave infrared (400–2400 nm) airborne hyperspectral imaging with high spatial (0.5 m) and spectral (3–5 nm) resolutions to accurately estimate critical crop traits, i.e., nitrogen, chlorophyll, and photosynthetic capacity (CO<inf>2</inf>-saturated photosynthesis rate, V<inf>max,27</inf>), at leaf and canopy scales, and to assess nitrogen deficiency on crop yield. We conducted three airborne campaigns over a maize (Zea mays L.) field during the growing season of 2019. Physically based soil-canopy Radiative Transfer Modeling (RTM) and data-driven approaches i.e. Partial-Least Squares Regression (PLSR) were used to retrieve crop traits from hyperspectral reflectance, with ground truth of leaf nitrogen, chlorophyll, V<inf>max,27</inf>, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and harvested grain yield. To improve computational efficiency of RTMs, Random Forest (RF) was used to mimic RTM simulations to generate machine learning surrogate models RTM-RF. The results show that prior knowledge of soil background and leaf angle distribution can significantly reduce the ill-posed RTM retrieval. RTM-RF achieved a high accuracy to predict leaf chlorophyll content (R2 = 0.73) and LAI (R2 = 0.75). Meanwhile, PLSR exhibited better accuracy to predict leaf chlorophyll content (R2 = 0.79), nitrogen concentration (R2 = 0.83), nitrogen content (R2 = 0.77), and V<inf>max,27</inf> (R2 = 0.69) but required measured traits for model training. We also found that canopy structure signals can enhance the use of spectral data to predict nitrogen related photosynthetic traits, as combining RTM-RF LAI and PLSR leaf traits well predicted canopy-level traits (leaf traits × LAI) including canopy chlorophyll (R2 = 0.80), nitrogen (R2 = 0.85) and V<inf>max,27</inf> (R2 = 0.82). Compared to leaf traits, we further found that canopy-level photosynthetic traits, particularly canopy V<inf>max,27</inf>, have higher correlation with maize grain yield. This study highlights the potential for synergistic use of process-based and data-driven approaches of hyperspectral imaging to quantify crop traits that facilitate precision agricultural management to secure food and bioenergy production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Airborne; Bioenergy Crop; Canopy; Chlorophyll; Hyperspectral; Leaf; Machine Learning; Maize; Nitrogen; Photosynthetic Capacity; Radiative Transfer Model; Yield; Chlorophyll; Computer Simulation; Crop Yield; Fertilizer Application; Gis; Machine Learning; Maize; Radiative Transfer; Satellite Data; Satellite Imagery; Yield Response,chlorophyll; computer simulation; crop yield; fertilizer application; GIS; machine learning; maize; radiative transfer; satellite data; satellite imagery; yield response,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121603790

As symptoms of these diseases can usually be identified by inspecting cassava leafs, visual diagnosis of cassava leaf diseases is of significant importance in food security and agriculture development. Considering the shortage of qualified agricultural experts, automatic approaches for the image-based detection of cassava leaf diseases are in great demand. In this paper, on the basis of Vision Transformer, we propose a deep learning method to identify the type of viral disease in a cassava leaf image. The image dataset of cassava leaves is provided by the Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab in a Kaggle competition, consisting of 4 subtypes of diseases and healthy cassava leaves. Our results show that Vision-Transformer-based model can effectively achieve an excellent performance regarding the classification of cassava leaf diseases. After applying the K-Fold cross validation technique, our model reaches a categorization accuracy 0.9002 on the private test set.

As Xanthomonas species are prevalent pathogens on a wide variety of important crops around the world, there is a need to distinguish between these plant-associated phenotypes. To date a large number of Xanthomonas genomes have been sequenced, which enables the application of machine learning (ML) approaches on the genome content to predict this phenotype. Until now such approaches to the pathogenomics of Xanthomonas strains have been hampered by the fragmentation of information regarding pathogenicity of individual strains over many studies. Unification of this information into a single resource was therefore considered to be an essential step. Results: Mining of 39 papers considering both plant-associated phenotypes, allowed for a phenotypic classification of 578 Xanthomonas strains. For 65 plant-pathogenic and 53 non-pathogenic strains the corresponding genomes were available and de novo annotated for the presence of Pfam protein domains used as features to train and compare three ML classification algorithms; CART, Lasso and Random Forest. Conclusion: The literature resource in combination with recursive feature extraction used in the ML classification algorithms provided further insights into the virulence enabling factors, but also highlighted domains linked to traits not present in pathogenic strains. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Machine Learning; Pathogenicity; Protein Domains; Xanthomonas; Article; Bacterial Strain; Classification Algorithm; Feature Extraction; Major Clinical Study; Mining; Nonhuman; Pathogenomics; Phenotype; Plant Disease; Protein Domain; Random Forest; Xanthomonas; Bacterial Genome; Genetics; Machine Learning; Plant; Genome, Bacterial; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plants","article; bacterial strain; classification algorithm; feature extraction; major clinical study; mining; nonhuman; pathogenomics; phenotype; plant disease; protein domain; random forest; Xanthomonas; bacterial genome; genetics; machine learning; plant; Genome, Bacterial; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plants",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119832438

Lowering NO<inf>3</inf>- ions (90% of total N) supply to 2/3 of the standard recommendations, which was electrochemically compensated for by an equivalent increase of the Cl- concentration in the replenishment nutrient solution (RNS), increased N use efficiency (kg produce kg−1 N supply) and decreased NO<inf>3</inf>- in the drainage without compromising growth, yield and nutritional quality. Tomato plants supplied with Cl--amended RNS increased leaf Cl- content to macronutrient level (35 mg g−1 dry weight), retaining photosynthetic rates and crop yield potential at lower stomatal conductivity and transpiration. Nutrient to water uptake ratios (mass of nutrient per water volume absorbed), which are commonly termed ‘uptake concentrations’, were defined in different cropping seasons and ranged as follows: 12.1–13.5 (Nitrogen- NO<inf>3</inf>-+NH<inf>4</inf>+), 1.25–1.35 (Phosphorus-P), 6.1–6.3 (Potassium-K), 3.6–4.0 (Calcium-Ca), 1.0–1.3 (Magnesium-Mg, mmol L−1), 13.0–14.3 (Iron-Fe), 7.6–8.4 (Manganese-Mn), 5.1–5.2 (Zinc-Zn) and 0.7–0.9 (Copper-Cu, μmol L−1). The levels of N and Cl- supply had no impact on the uptake concentrations. This study suggests that replacing 1/3 of the standard NO<inf>3</inf>- supply by Cl- in closed hydroponic tomato crops enhances N use by two-fold and eliminates NO<inf>3</inf>- losses to one-half, with no significant effects on assimilation processes and fruit biomass production, suggesting that Cl- at appropriate concentrations is not only an essential micronutrient but also a beneficial macronutrient.

Despite damages caused by SCYLV, the genetic base of resistance to this virus remains largely unknown. Several methodologies have arisen to identify molecular markers associated with SCYLV resistance, which are crucial for marker-assisted selection and understanding response mechanisms to this virus. We investigated the genetic base of SCYLV resistance using dominant and codominant markers and genotypes of interest for sugarcane breeding. A sugarcane panel inoculated with SCYLV was analyzed for SCYL symptoms, and viral titer was estimated by RT-qPCR. This panel was genotyped with 662 dominant markers and 70,888 SNPs and indels with allele proportion information. We used polyploid-adapted genome-wide association analyses and machine-learning algorithms coupled with feature selection methods to establish marker-trait associations. While each approach identified unique marker sets associated with phenotypes, convergences were observed between them and demonstrated their complementarity. Lastly, we annotated these markers, identifying genes encoding emblematic participants in virus resistance mechanisms and previously unreported candidates involved in viral responses. Our approach could accelerate sugarcane breeding targeting SCYLV resistance and facilitate studies on biological processes leading to this trait. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Plant Proteins; Plant Protein; Disease Resistance; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Genome-wide Association Study; Genotype; Growth, Development And Aging; Immunology; Luteoviridae; Metabolism; Phylogeny; Physiology; Plant Breeding; Plant Chromosome; Plant Disease; Plant Genome; Plant Leaf; Quantitative Trait Locus; Sugarcane; Virology; Chromosomes, Plant; Disease Resistance; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Genome-wide Association Study; Genotype; Phylogeny; Plant Breeding; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Quantitative Trait Loci; Saccharum","plant protein; disease resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; growth, development and aging; immunology; Luteoviridae; metabolism; phylogeny; physiology; plant breeding; plant chromosome; plant disease; plant genome; plant leaf; quantitative trait locus; sugarcane; virology; Chromosomes, Plant; Disease Resistance; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Phylogeny; Plant Breeding; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Quantitative Trait Loci; Saccharum",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112014467

The small RNAs (sRNAs) of Magnaporthe oryzae use the RNAi mechanism of rice to realize the infection process, and different effector proteins can increase the autotoxicity by inhibiting pathogen-associated molecular patterns triggered immunity (PTI) to achieve the purpose of infection. However, the coordination of sRNAs and proteins in the process of M. oryzae infecting rice is still poorly understood. Therefore, the combination of transcriptomics and proteomics to study the mechanism of M. oryzae infecting rice has important theoretical significance and practical value for controlling rice diseases and improving rice yields. In this paper, we used the high-throughput data of various omics before and after the M. oryzae infecting rice to screen differentially expressed genes and sRNAs and predict protein interaction pairs based on the interolog and the domain-domain methods. We were then used to construct a prediction model of the M. oryzae-rice interaction proteins according to the obtained proteins in the proteomic network. Finally, for the differentially expressed genes, differentially expressed sRNAs, the corresponding mRNAs of rice and M. oryzae, and the interacting protein molecules, the M. oryzae-rice sRNA regulatory network was built and analyzed, the core nodes were selected. The functional enrichment analysis was conducted to explore the potential effect pathways and the critical infection factors of M. oryzae sRNAs and proteins were mined and analyzed. The results showed that 22 sRNAs of M. oryzae, 77 secretory proteins of M. oryzae were used as effect factors to participate in the infection process of M. oryzae. And many significantly enriched GO modules were discovered, which were related to the infection mechanism of M. oryzae. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Machine Learning; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Multi-omics; Protein; Rice; Srna; Transfer Rna; Asparagine Linked Oligosaccharide; Messenger Rna; Myelin Associated Glycoprotein; Secretory Protein; Transfer Rna; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Biogenesis; Data Processing; Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane; Functional Enrichment Analysis; Gene Expression; Gene Silencing; Genomics; Machine Learning; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Mycosis; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Excision Repair; Plant Disease; Plant Yield; Protein Domain; Protein Expression; Protein Metabolism; Protein Protein Interaction; Proteomics; Purine Metabolism; Pyrimidine Metabolism; Rice; Rna Interference; Transcriptomics,asparagine linked oligosaccharide; messenger RNA; myelin associated glycoprotein; secretory protein; transfer RNA; amino acid sequence; Article; biogenesis; data processing; endoplasmic reticulum membrane; functional enrichment analysis; gene expression; gene silencing; genomics; machine learning; Magnaporthe oryzae; mycosis; nonhuman; nucleotide excision repair; plant disease; plant yield; protein domain; protein expression; protein metabolism; protein protein interaction; proteomics; purine metabolism; pyrimidine metabolism; rice; RNA interference; transcriptomics,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120436247

Recent breakthroughs in protein structure modeling have demonstrated the feasibility to predict the protein folds without depending on homologous templates. These advances enabled a genome-wide computational structural biology approach to help understand proteins based on their predicted folds. In this study, we employed structure prediction methods on the secretome of the destructive fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Out of 1,854 secreted proteins, we predicted the folds of 1,295 proteins (70%). We showed that template-free modeling by TrRosetta captured 514 folds missed by homology modeling, including many known effectors and virulence factors, and that TrRosetta generally produced higher quality models for secreted proteins. Along with sensitive homology search, we employed structure-based clustering, defining not only homologous groups with divergent members but also sequence-unrelated structurally analogous groups. We demonstrate that this approach can reveal new putative members of structurally similar MAX effectors and novel analogous effector families present in M. oryzae and possibly in other phytopathogens. We also investigated the evolution of expanded putative ADP-ribose transferases with predicted structures. We suggest that the loss of catalytic activities of the enzymes might have led them to new evolutionary trajectories to be specialized as protein binders. Collectively, we propose that computational structural genomics approaches can be an integral part of studying effector biology and provide valuable resources that were inaccessible before the advent of machine learning-based structure prediction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computational Structural Genomics; Effectors; Fungal Effectors; Fungus–plant Interactions; Genomics; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Phytopathogen; Structure; Fungal Proteins; Fungal Protein; Ascomycetes; Genetics; Genomics; Magnaporthe; Metabolism; Oryza; Plant Disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Genomics; Plant Diseases; Secretome,fungal protein; Ascomycetes; genetics; genomics; Magnaporthe; metabolism; Oryza; plant disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Genomics; Plant Diseases; Secretome,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122441203

In this study, several models for forecasting sugarcane yields were developed and compared in the north of Ivory Coast (West Africa). These models were based on statistical methods, ranging from linear regression to machine learning algorithms such as the random forest method, fed by climate data (rainfall, temperature); satellite products (NDVI, EVI from MODIS Vegetation Index product) and information on cropping practices. The results show that the forecasting of sugarcane yield depended on the area considered. At the plot level, the noise due to cultivation practices can hide the effects of climate on yields and leads to poor forecasting performance. However, models using satellite variables are more efficient and those with EVI alone may explain 43% of yield variations. Moreover, taking into account cultural practices in the model improves the score and enables one to forecast 3 months before harvest in 50% and 69% of cases whether yields will be high or low, respectively, with errors of only 10% and 2%, respectively.

While TMV induced the accumulation of an average of 40 virus inclusion bodies in the cytosol, which covered about 13% of the cell volume, ZYMV caused the accumulation of an average of 1752 cylindrical inclusions in the cytosol, which covered about 2.7% of the total volume of the cell.

Predicting accurately with well-timed forecasts is important, but it is a difficult task due to numerous complex factors. Mostly crops like wheat, rice, peas, pulses, sugar cane, tea, cotton, green houses, corn, and soybean can all be used to forecast crop yields. We considered corn dataset to predict the yield for 13 different states in United States. Crop development and progression are strongly affected by climatic changes and unpredictability. Predicting crop yield well before harvest time will support farmers for selling and storing their crops. Agriculture involves large datasets and knowledge processes. Factors such as Weather Components, Soil Components, Management practices, genotype and their interactions are used in predicting Corn Yield. Precise crop growth generally necessitates a complete overview of the functional correlations between yield and all these interactive variables, which necessitates the use of large datasets and complex algorithms to demonstrate. Various Machine Learning models, Deep Learning models, and Artificial Neural Network algorithms are used for predicting.

However, when exposed to a diverse range of abiotic stresses, their overall productivity and quality are hugely impacted. Our limited understanding of genetic determinants and novel variants associated with the abiotic stress response in food legume crops restricts its amelioration. Therefore, it is imperative to understand different molecular approaches in food legume crops that can be utilized in crop improvement programs to minimize the economic loss. ‘Omics’-based molecular breeding provides better opportunities over conventional breeding for diversifying the natural germplasm together with improving yield and quality parameters. Due to molecular advancements, the technique is now equipped with novel ‘omics’ approaches such as ionomics, epigenomics, fluxomics, RNomics, glycomics, glycoproteomics, phosphoproteomics, lipidomics, regulomics, and secretomics. Pan-omics—which utilizes the molecular bases of the stress response to identify genes (genomics), mRNAs (transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics), and biomolecules (metabolomics) associated with stress regulation—has been widely used for abiotic stress amelioration in food legume crops. Integration of pan-omics with novel omics approaches will fast-track legume breeding programs. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms can be utilized for simulating crop yield under changing environments, which can help in predicting the genetic gain beforehand. Application of machine learning (ML) in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mining will further help in determining the genetic determinants of abiotic stress tolerance in pulses. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abiotic Stress; Artificial Intelligence; Climate Change; Food Legumes; Genetic Gain; Machine Learning; Omics-assisted Breeding; Pan-omics; Messenger Rna; Trace Element; Abiotic Stress; Aluminum Overload; Artificial Intelligence; Chickpea; Climate Change; Cowpea; Crop Improvement; Environmental Resilience; Epigenetics; Fabaceae; Fluxomics; Genetic Gain; Genomics; Glycomics; Glycoproteomics; Ionomics; Legume; Lentil; Lipidomics; Lotus Japonicus; Machine Learning; Mung Bean; Nonhuman; Omics; Peanut; Phosphoproteomics; Physiological Stress; Protein Glycosylation; Proteomics; Quantitative Trait Locus; Review; Secretomics; Soybean; Transcriptomics; Crop; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Plant Breeding; Artificial Intelligence; Crops, Agricultural; Genomics; Plant Breeding; Quantitative Trait Loci; Stress, Physiological","messenger RNA; trace element; abiotic stress; aluminum overload; artificial intelligence; chickpea; climate change; cowpea; crop improvement; environmental resilience; epigenetics; Fabaceae; fluxomics; genetic gain; genomics; glycomics; glycoproteomics; ionomics; legume; lentil; lipidomics; Lotus japonicus; machine learning; mung bean; nonhuman; omics; peanut; phosphoproteomics; physiological stress; protein glycosylation; proteomics; quantitative trait locus; Review; secretomics; soybean; transcriptomics; crop; genetics; growth, development and aging; plant breeding; Artificial Intelligence; Crops, Agricultural; Genomics; Plant Breeding; Quantitative Trait Loci; Stress, Physiological",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116017621

Rapid detection and mapping of resulting infestation at orchard scale is a challenge with existing laborious manual scouting approaches. Therefore, this study explored the feasibility of detecting and mapping PM infestation in an apple orchard block using high-resolution visible (red-green-blue [RGB]) and multispectral imaging technique. Imaging campaigns were conducted over an experimental orchard using small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) integrated with the above optical sensors. K-means classifier trained on individual snapshots of RGB imagery had mean disease detection accuracy of 77%. Eight multispectral vegetation indices also showed significant differences (p < 0.001) between healthy (Mean: 0.25–0.84) and infected (Mean: 0.01–0.25) leaves. Modified Simple Ratio-Red (MSR<inf>R</inf>), Modified Simple Ratio-Blue (MSR<inf>B</inf>), and Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) showed the highest contrast (Mean: 0.46–0.79). Orchard block-scale mapping using RGB orthomosaic layer, classified with k-means and spectral angle mapper techniques had accuracies up to 73%. Overall, high resolution imagery in the visible and multispectral domain could sufficiently detect the infection and generate site-specific disease heat maps. These maps could be useful to apple growers in directing prescriptive resources ( pruning labor or fungicide application) for PM management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Apple Powdery Mildew; Classification; High Resolution Visible And Multispectral Imagery; Infestation Heat Maps; Vegetation Indices; Crop Yield; Detection Method; Fungal Disease; Image Analysis; Image Resolution; Index Method; Multispectral Image; Orchard; Pruning,crop yield; detection method; fungal disease; image analysis; image resolution; index method; multispectral image; orchard; pruning,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107661115

This novel growing technology could influence the crop yield and ensure the quality and safety of seeds, in a sustainable way. When nanoprimed seeds are germinated, they undergo a series of synergistic events as a result of enhanced metabolism: modulating biochemical signaling pathways, trigger hormone secretion, reduce reactive oxygen species leading to improved disease resistance.

Vesicatoria (Xcv), severely affects the quality and yield of pepper. Thus, breeding new pepper cultivars with enhanced resistance to BS can improve economic benefits for pepper production. Identification of BS resistance genes is an essential step to achieve this goal. However, very few BS resistance genes have been well characterized in pepper so far. In this study, we reanalyzed public multiple time points related to RNA-seq data sets from two pepper cultivars, the Xcv-susceptible cultivar ECW and the Xcv-resistant cultivar VI037601, post Xcv infection. We identified a total of 3568 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two cultivars post Xcv infection, which were mainly involved in some biological processes, such as Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to defense response to bacterium, immune system process, and regulation of defense response, etc. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified 15 hub (Hub) transcription factor (TF) candidates in response to Xcv infection. We further selected 20 TFs from the gene regulatory network (GRN) potentially involved in Xcv resistance response. Finally, we predicted 4 TFs, C3H (p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase), ERF (ethylene-responsive element binding factor), TALE (three-amino-acid-loop-extension), and HSF (heat shock transcription factor), as key factors responsible for BS disease resistance in pepper. In conclusion, our study provides valuable resources for dissecting the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for Xcv resistance in pepper. Additionally, it also provides valuable references for mining transcriptomic data to identify key candidates for disease resistance in horticulture crops. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-expression Module; Gene Regulatory Network; Pepper; Rna-seq; Xcv; Plant Proteins; Transcription Factors; 4 Coumarate 3 Hydroxylase; Ethylene Responsive Element Binding Factor; Heat Shock Transcription Factor; Three Amino Acid Loop Extension; Transcription Factor; Unclassified Drug; Plant Protein; Article; Bacterial Leaf Spot; Controlled Study; Cultivar; Data Mining; Differential Gene Expression; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Network; Horticulture; Immune System; Nonhuman; Pepper; Protein Analysis; Protein Expression; Rna Sequencing; Transcriptomics; Weighted Gene Co Expression Network Analysis; Xanthomonas Campestris; Xanthomonas Campestris Pv.

Live cell imaging and quantitative 4D image analysis have provided new insight into the mechanisms by which the fungus infects host cells and spreads rapidly in plant tissue. In this video review article, we apply live cell imaging approaches to understanding the cell and developmental biology of rice blast disease. To gain entry to host plants, M. oryzae develops a specialised infection structure called an appressorium, a unicellular dome-shaped cell which generates enormous turgor, translated into mechanical force to rupture the leaf cuticle. Appressorium development is induced by perception of the hydrophobic leaf surface and nutrient deprivation. Cargo-independent autophagy in the three-celled conidium, controlled by cell cycle regulation, is essential for appressorium morphogenesis. Appressorium maturation involves turgor generation and melanin pigment deposition in the appressorial cell wall. Once a threshold of turgor has been reached, this triggers re-polarisation which requires regulated generation of reactive oxygen species, to facilitate septin GTPase-dependent cytoskeletal re-organisation and re-polarisation of the appressorium to form a narrow, rigid penetration peg. Infection of host tissue requires a further morphogenetic transition to a pseudohyphal-type of growth within colonised rice cells. At the same time the fungus secretes an arsenal of effector proteins to suppress plant immunity. Many effectors are secreted into host cells directly, which involves a specific secretory pathway and a specialised structure called the biotrophic interfacial complex. Cell-to-cell spread of the fungus then requires development of a specialised structure, the transpressorium, that is used to traverse pit field sites, allowing the fungus to maintain host cell membrane integrity as new living plant cells are invaded. Thereafter, the fungus rapidly moves through plant tissue and host cells begin to die, as the fungus switches to necrotrophic growth and disease symptoms develop. These morphogenetic transitions are reviewed in the context of live cell imaging studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Actin; Appressorium; Biotrophy; Effectors; Necrotrophy; Septins; Guanosine Triphosphatase; Fungal Proteins; Guanosine Triphosphatase; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Fungal Protein; Mycosis; Article; Autophagy (cellular); Cell Cycle Regulation; Conidium; Cuticle; Cytology; Cytoskeleton; Developmental Biology; Fungal Cell; Fungal Cell Wall; Fungal Colonization; Fungal Development; Fungus Growth; Host Cell; Hydrophobicity; Leaf Surface; Live Cell Imaging; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Maturation; Morphogenesis; Nonhuman; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaf; Plant Nutrient; Rice Blast; Cell Wall; Growth, Development And Aging; Immunology; Magnaporthe; Metabolism; Microbiology; Oryza; Plant Cell; Plant Disease; Cell Wall; Fungal Proteins; Mycoses; Plant Cells; Plant Diseases","guanosine triphosphatase; reactive oxygen metabolite; fungal protein; mycosis; Article; autophagy (cellular); cell cycle regulation; conidium; cuticle; cytology; cytoskeleton; developmental biology; fungal cell; fungal cell wall; fungal colonization; fungal development; fungus growth; host cell; hydrophobicity; leaf surface; live cell imaging; Magnaporthe oryzae; maturation; morphogenesis; nonhuman; plant immunity; plant leaf; plant nutrient; rice blast; cell wall; growth, development and aging; immunology; Magnaporthe; metabolism; microbiology; Oryza; plant cell; plant disease; Cell Wall; Fungal Proteins; Mycoses; Plant Cells; Plant Diseases",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107048274

The disease is highly destructive, because it produces latent asymptomatic infections that favor contagion rates. The present research aims consisted on the implementation of Raman spectroscopy (RS) and machine-learning spectral analysis as a method for the early disease detection. Raman spectra were obtained from infected asymptomatic tomato plants (BCTo) and healthy controls (HTo) with 785 nm excitation laser micro-Raman spectrometer. Spectral data were normalized and processed by principal component analysis (PCA), then the classifiers algorithms multilayer perceptron (PCA + MLP) and linear discriminant analysis (PCA + LDA) were implemented. Bacterial isolation and identification (16S rRNA gene sequencing) were realized of each plant studied. The Raman spectra obtained from tomato leaf samples of HTo and BCTo exhibited peaks associated to cellular components, and the most prominent vibrational bands were assigned to carbohydrates, carotenoids, chlorophyll, and phenolic compounds. Biochemical changes were also detectable in the Raman spectral patterns. Raman bands associated with triterpenoids and flavonoids compounds can be considered as indicators of Cmm infection during the asymptomatic stage. RS is an efficient, fast and reliable technology to differentiate the tomato health condition (BCTo or HTo).

Therefore, phenotyping to enhance resilience to these abiotic stresses is critical for sustaining genetic gains in crop improvement programs. However, traditional methods for screening traits related to these stresses are slow, laborious, and often expensive. Remote sensing provides opportunities to introduce low-cost, less biased, high-Throughput phenotyping methods to capture large genetic diversity to facilitate enhancement of stress resilience in crops. This review focuses on four key physiological traits and processes that are critical in understanding crop responses to drought and heat stress during reproductive and grain-filling periods. Specifically, these traits include: (i) time of day of flowering, to escape these stresses during flowering; (ii) optimizing photosynthetic efficiency; (iii) storage and translocation of water-soluble carbohydrates; and (iv) yield and yield components to provide in-season yield estimates. Moreover, we provide an overview of current advances in remote sensing in capturing these traits, and discuss the limitations with existing technology as well as future direction of research to develop high-Throughput phenotyping approaches. In the future, phenotyping these complex traits will require sensor advancement, high-quality imagery combined with machine learning methods, and efforts in transdisciplinary science to foster integration across disciplines. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Drought Stress; Field-based High-throughput Phenotyping; Heat Stress; Photosynthetic Efficiency; Remote Sensing; Time Of Day Of Flowering; Water-soluble Carbohydrates; Yield Estimation,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107397612

Accurate and reliable irrigation system performance and water productivity information is required in order to assess and improve the current water management strategies. This study evaluates the spatially distributed irrigation equity, adequacy and crop water productivity (CWP) for two water-intensive crops, alfalfa and sugar beet, using remotely sensed data and a geographical information system for the 2018/2019 crop growing season. The actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) was mapped in Google Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux, using the linear interpolation method in R version 4.0.2. The approx() function in the base R was used to produce daily ETa maps, and then totaled to compute the ETa for the whole season. The equity and adequacy were determined according to the ETa’s coefficient of variation (CV) and relative evapotranspiration (RET), respectively. The crop classification was performed using a machine learning approach (a random forest algorithm). The CWP was computed as a ratio of the crop yield to the crop water use, employing yield disaggregation to map the crop yield, using county-level production statistics data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. The relative errors (RE) of the ETa compared to the reported literature values were 7–27% for alfalfa and 0–3% for sugar beet. The average ETa variation was low; however, the spatial variation within the fields showed that 35% had a variability greater than 10%. The RET was high, indicating adequate irrigation; 31.5% of the alfalfa and 12% of the sugar beet fields clustered in the Valley’s central corner were consuming more water than their potential visibly. The CWP showed wide variation, with CVs of 32.92% for alfalfa and 25.4% for sugar beet, signifying a substantial scope for CWP enhancement. The correlation between the CWP, ETa and yield showed that reducing the ETa to approximately 1500 mm for alfalfa and 1200 mm for sugar beet would help boost the CWP without decreasing the yield, which is nearly equivalent to 44.52M cu. m (36,000 acre-ft) of water. The study’s results could help water managers to identify poorly performing fields where water conservation and management could be focused. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cwp; Eeflux; Irrigation Performance; Ndvi; Water Conservation; Crop Yield; Detection Method; Evapotranspiration; Interpolation; Irrigation System; Machine Learning; Ndvi; Spatial Variation; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Vegetation Index; Water Management; Imperial Valley; Beta Vulgaris Subsp.

Oxalic acid is the main pathogenicity factor of S. sclerotiorum. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry have been used in several studies to investigate molecular changes that occur in the plants in response to S. sclerotiorum infection. Comparing responses of resistant and susceptible lines upon pathogen infection provided novel information regarding defense mechanisms against this necrotrophic pathogen. Objectives: The present study reports proteome changes of partially resistant and susceptible sunflower lines under pathogen’s culture filtrate treatment, resulting in the characterization of up-and down-regulated proteins. Material and Methods: Sunflower partially resistant and susceptible lines with two true leaves were exposed to fungus culture filtrate. The stems of treated and untreated plants were sampled at 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment for two-dimensional electrophoresis. Twenty spots showed more than 1.5-fold change in abundance were subjected to MALDI/ TOF-TOF MS for further analysis. Results: The identified proteins were categorized into several classes including carbohydrate and energy metabolism (25%), cellular metabolic process (15%), stress response (15%), plant cell wall biogenesis (10%), photosynthesis (10%), protein metabolism (10%), unknown function (10%) and redox homeostasis (5%). Conclusions: Our proteomic investigation demonstrates an increase in the expression of proteins only in partially resistant line, such as proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and plant defense responses (malate dehydrogenase and peroxidase), metabolic process (adenosine kinase), regulating cell redox homeostasis (disulfide isomerase) and lignin biosynthetic process (laccase). Moreover, the expression of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, involved in proline biosynthesis, was significantly changed in both sunflower lines in response to pathogen culture filtrate. Proteins which were only up-regulated in the partially resistant lines might have a significant role in mediating the defense against Sclerotinia and could be considered for enhancing resistance against this devastating pathogen. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",2-de; Biotic Stress; Sclerotinia; Sunflower; Tolerance; 3 [(3 Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio] 1 Propanesulfonic Acid; Acetic Acid; Acetone; Acetonitrile; Adenosine Kinase; Agar; Bicarbonate; Brilliant Blue G; Dithiothreitol; Dodecyl Sulfate Sodium; Glycerol; Iodoacetamide; Laccase; Lignin; Malate Dehydrogenase; Methanol; Nicotinic Acid; Oxalic Acid; Oxidoreductase; Peroxidase; Proline; Protein Disulfide Isomerase; Pyridoxine; Pyrroline 5 Carboxylate Reductase; Thiamine; Thiourea; Trometamol; Trypsin; Urea; Mini Protean Tetra Cell; Zorbax Eclipse Xdb C18; 3 [(3 Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio] 1 Propanesulfonic Acid; Acetic Acid; Acetone; Acetonitrile; Adenosine Kinase; Agar; Bicarbonate; Brilliant Blue G; Buffer; Dithiothreitol; Dodecyl Sulfate Sodium; Glycerol; Iodoacetamide; Laccase; Lignin; Liquid Nitrogen; Malate Dehydrogenase; Methanol; Nicotinic Acid; Oxalic Acid; Oxidoreductase; Peroxidase; Polyacrylamide Gel; Proline; Protein Disulfide Isomerase; Proteome; Pyridoxine; Pyrroline 5 Carboxylate Reductase; Sclerotinia Sclerotiorum Extract; Thiamine; Thiourea; Trometamol; Trypsin; Urea; Article; Biogenesis; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cell Metabolism; Cell Wall; Cellular Stress Response; Centrifugation; Defense Mechanism; Down Regulation; Energy Metabolism; Fungus Culture; Gene Overexpression; Homeostasis; Image Analysis; Incubation Time; Infectious Agent; Inoculation; Mass Spectrometry; Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry; Mycelial Growth; Mycelium; Mycosis; Nonhuman; Pathogenicity; Photosynthesis; Plant Defense; Plant Disease; Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis; Precipitation; Protein Determination; Protein Metabolism; Room Temperature; Sclerotinia Sclerotiorum; Sunflower; Two Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis; Upregulation,3 [(3 cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio] 1 propanesulfonic acid; acetic acid; acetone; acetonitrile; adenosine kinase; agar; bicarbonate; brilliant blue g; buffer; dithiothreitol; dodecyl sulfate sodium; glycerol; iodoacetamide; laccase; lignin; liquid nitrogen; malate dehydrogenase; methanol; nicotinic acid; oxalic acid; oxidoreductase; peroxidase; polyacrylamide gel; proline; protein disulfide isomerase; proteome; pyridoxine; pyrroline 5 carboxylate reductase; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum extract; thiamine; thiourea; trometamol; trypsin; urea; Article; biogenesis; carbohydrate metabolism; cell metabolism; cell wall; cellular stress response; centrifugation; defense mechanism; down regulation; energy metabolism; fungus culture; gene overexpression; homeostasis; image analysis; incubation time; infectious agent; inoculation; mass spectrometry; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; mycelial growth; mycelium; mycosis; nonhuman; pathogenicity; photosynthesis; plant defense; plant disease; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; precipitation; protein determination; protein metabolism; room temperature; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; sunflower; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; upregulation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113819590

Recent studies with remote sensing (RS) sensors at different scales have shown that Xf-infected olive trees have distinct spectral features in the visible and infrared regions (VNIR). However, further work is needed to integrate remote sensing in the management of plant disease epidemics. Here, we research how the spectral changes picked up by different sets of RS plant traits (i.e., pigments, structural or leaf protein content), can help capture the spatial dynamics of Xf spread. We coupled a spatial spread model with the probability of Xf-infection predicted by a RS-driven support vector machine (RS-SVM) model. Furthermore, we analyzed which RS plant traits contribute most to the output of the prediction models. For that, in almond orchards affected by Xf (n = 1426 trees), we conducted a field campaign simultaneously with an airborne campaign to collect high-resolution thermal images and hyperspectral images in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400–850 nm) and short-wave infrared regions (SWIR, 950–1700 nm). The best performing RS-SVM model (OA = 75%; kappa = 0.50) included as predictors leaf protein content, nitrogen indices (NIs), fluorescence and a thermal indicator (T<inf>c</inf>), alongside pigments and structural parameters. Leaf protein content together with NIs contributed 28% to the explanatory power of the model, followed by chlorophyll (22%), structural parameters (LAI and LIDF<inf>a</inf>), and chlorophyll indicators of photosynthetic efficiency. Coupling the RS model with an epidemic spread model increased the accuracy (OA = 80%; kappa = 0.48). In the almond trees where the presence of Xf was assayed by qPCR (n = 318 trees), the combined RS-spread model yielded an OA of 71% and kappa = 0.33, which is higher than the RS-only model and visual inspections (both OA = 64–65% and kappa = 0.26–31). Our work demonstrates how combining spatial epidemiological models and remote sensing can lead to highly accurate predictions of plant disease spatial distribution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Epidemic Spread Model; Hyperspectral; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; Radiative Transfer Model; Swir Domain; Thermal; Xylella Fastidiosa; Bacteria; Chlorophyll; Epidemiology; Forestry; Infrared Devices; Infrared Radiation; Nitrogen; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Probability Distributions; Proteins; Remote Sensing; Support Vector Machines; Viruses; Epidemic Spread Model; Hyperspectral; Leaf Proteins; Machine-learning; Plant Traits; Radiative Transfer Modelling; Remote-sensing; Swir Domain; Thermal; Xylella Fastidiosa; Radiative Transfer; Detection Method; Disease Spread; Disinfection; Ecological Modeling; Epidemic; Host-pathogen Interaction; Infectious Disease; Orchard; Remote Sensing; Spatial Distribution; Indicator Indicator; Prunus Dulcis,Bacteria; Chlorophyll; Epidemiology; Forestry; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Nitrogen; Polymerase chain reaction; Probability distributions; Proteins; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Viruses; Epidemic spread model; HyperSpectral; Leaf proteins; Machine-learning; Plant traits; Radiative transfer modelling; Remote-sensing; SWIR domain; Thermal; Xylella fastidiosa; Radiative transfer; detection method; disease spread; disinfection; ecological modeling; epidemic; host-pathogen interaction; infectious disease; orchard; remote sensing; spatial distribution; Indicator indicator; Prunus dulcis,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105692819

Nowadays, precision agriculture aims to optimize investments and yields taking into account environmental and conditions variability between different plots, influencing every aspect of agriculture such as tillage, seeding, fertilization, irrigation and pesticide spraying. In order to achieve all these goals, development of new sensors and field data gathering must be taken into account. In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in agriculture as part of photogrammetric and remote sensing tasks, but new opportunities arise also in pesticide distribution. In this case, high resolution images are required, introducing a technical complexity linked to data transfer and storage. One possibility is to store only images requiring a post processing, dropping all images proposing a standard healthy crop. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning (DL) in particular, allows larger learning capabilities and thus higher performance and precision of real-time classification and detection. The aim of this work is to develop and test a DL model in order to detect in real-time plants diseases. The neural network has been trained with a data set of RGB images, then tested on a test set. The system adopted a convolutional neural network (CNN) as feature extractors from the input images and TensorFlow as framework, showing good results in disease detection. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agriculture; Ai; Dl; Ml; Plant Disease; Remote Sensing; Sensors; Uav,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107825800

The large availability of satellite sensors and advanced techniques for processing data have improved the forecasting sugarcane yield on a local and global scale, but more work is needed on exploiting the synergy between remote sensing, meteorological and agronomic data. In this study, we combined such data sources to forecast sugarcane yield using a random forest (RF) algorithm on an extensive area of 50,000 ha, over four years. Images from Landsat satellites were processed to time series of surface reflectance and spectral indices. The approach focused on the development of predictive models which only used data acquired and accessible several months before the harvest. First, three RF models were calibrated with different predictors to forecast the sugarcane yield at harvest: using Landsat satellite images and meteorological data (RF<inf>1</inf>); agronomic and meteorological data (RF<inf>2</inf>); a combination of Landsat satellite images, agronomic and meteorological data (RF<inf>3</inf>). As a comparison, we also tested the influence of including knowledge on the future harvest date in the models RF<inf>2</inf> and RF<inf>3</inf> (RF<inf>4</inf> and RF<inf>5</inf>). The average values of R2 for RF<inf>1</inf>, RF<inf>2</inf>, and RF<inf>3</inf> were 0.66, 0.50 and 0.74, respectively. The model with the highest values of R2 (RF<inf>3</inf>) had a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 9.9 ton ha−1 on yield forecast, approximately 15% of the yield average. Including the harvest date improved the RF<inf>2</inf> and RF<inf>3</inf> models to reach R2 = 0.69 and RMSE = 10.8 ton ha−1 for RF<inf>4</inf>, and R2 = 0.76 and RMSE of 9.4 ton ha−1 for RF<inf>5</inf>. A blind forecasting test for the 2016 yields showed similar prediction than the forecast made by in situ field expertise. This result has the potential to assist management of sugarcane production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Yield; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Vegetation Indices; Agronomy; Data Handling; Decision Trees; Harvesting; Learning Systems; Meteorology; Remote Sensing; Satellites; Crop Yield; Local Scale; Machine-learning; Meteorological Data; Random Forest Algorithm; Random Forests; Remote-sensing; Root Mean Square Errors; Sugarcane Yield; Vegetation Index; Mean Square Error; Agricultural Modeling; Agrometeorology; Algorithm; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Forecasting Method; Landsat; Satellite Imagery; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sugar Beet; Sugar Cane; Surface Reflectance; Brazil,Agronomy; Data handling; Decision trees; Harvesting; Learning systems; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Satellites; Crop yield; Local scale; Machine-learning; Meteorological data; Random forest algorithm; Random forests; Remote-sensing; Root mean square errors; Sugarcane yield; Vegetation index; Mean square error; agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; algorithm; crop production; crop yield; forecasting method; Landsat; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; sugar beet; sugar cane; surface reflectance; Brazil,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105019598

Vegetable farming is one of the wide-scale businesses across the world. Many times, Vegetable plants are attacked by different diseases which consequences a heavy deficit for farmers. Early prognosis of these plant diseases can help to overcome this loss. Due to the variation of these diseases, it is difficult to identify the attacking disease. Deep learning models can be used for early detection of these diseased plants and appropriate measurements can be taken to minimize deficit. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based model for the early prognosis and classification of plant diseases. We have tuned a deep learning-based pretrained model in 2 folds over a publicly available dataset that contains images of different plants suffering from different diseases as well as healthy plants. We are envisioned to classify each instance as healthy or the name of the disease, the plant is being suffered. This transfer learning method has achieved remarkable results on this data-set of tomato plants and achieved 98.89% accuracy.

The objective of this paper is to present the FluorSpec system providing SIF measurements at the field level onboard a UAV, and to evaluate the potential of this system for understanding diurnal SIF patterns for different arable crops. The core components of FluorSpec are a point spectrometer configured to measure in the O<inf>2</inf> absorption bands at sub-nanometer resolution, bifurcated fibre optics to switch between the downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance measurements, and a laser range finder allowing accurate atmospheric correction. The processing chain is explained and the capability of the novel Spectral Shape Assumption Fraunhofer Line Discrimination (SSA-FLD) method to retrieve SIF was tested. To test the reliability of FluorSpec diurnal SIF measurements, near-canopy diurnal SIF was monitored during the growing season over potato and sugar beet plants with a ground-based setup. The two crops exhibited a clear diurnal SIF pattern, which positively correlated with the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The divergence in diurnal patterns between SIF and PAR indicated that the crops might be suffering from heat stress. A significant correlation between SIF and the Photosystem II Quantum Yield was obtained. By mounting the FluorSpec on a UAV, SIF measurements were obtained over the same crops during a clear day. UAV-based SIF also exhibited a pronounced diurnal pattern similar to the ground-based measurements and it showed clear spatial variation within different crop fields. The obtained results demonstrate the ability of the FluorSpec system to reliably measure plant fluorescence at ground and field level, and the possibility of the UAV-based FluorSpec to bridge the scale gap between different levels of SIF observations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Traits; Diurnal Patterns; Sun-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Chlorophyll; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Image Analysis; Image Resolution; Spatial Resolution; Spectrometer; Unmanned Vehicle; Beta Vulgaris Subsp.

Due to the saturation of AGB in multiple growth periods estimated by traditional vegetation indexes (VIs). Therefore, the study attempts to use VIs combined high-frequency information extracted by image wavelet decomposition (IWD) based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technology and wavelet coefficients extracted by continuous wavelet transform (CWT) technology, explore the estimation capabilities of VIs, VIs+IWD and VIs+CWT for AGB. Firstly, the hyperspectral and digital images of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and measured AGB were acquired during the potato budding stage, tuber formation stage, tuber growth stage, and starch accumulation stage. Secondly, three high-frequency information were extractedby using digital images through IWD technology, wavelet coefficients were extracted by using hyperspectral reflectance through CWT technology and six hyperspectral vegetation indexes were constructed. Then, the correlation between vegetation index, high-frequency information and wavelet coefficients and AGB was analyzed, and the top 10 bands with high absolute values of correlation coefficients at different scales were selected. Finally, the partial least square regression (PLSR) was used to construct and compare AGB estimation models with VIs, VIs+IWD and VIs+CWT. The results showed that: (1) 6 vegetation indexes, 3 high-frequency information and 10 wavelet coefficients selected in each growth period were significantly correlated with AGB, and the correlation decreased after increased in the whole growth period, in which the wavelet coefficients was the highest, the nextwas high frequency information, and the vegetation index was the lowest. (2) The three estimation models of each growth period were compared and analyzed, the estimation effect of VIs+CWT was the best, and that of VIs was the worst, indicating that the model based on wavelet analysis has wide applicability and strong stability. (3) The AGB estimation models constructed by PLSR method with three variables in each growth period reached the highest accuracy in the tuber growth period (VIs: modeling R2=0.70, RMSE=98.88 kg•hm-2, NRMSE=11.63%; VIs+IWD: modeling R2=0.78, RMSE=86.45 kg•hm-2, NRMSE=10.17%; VIs+CWT: modeling R2=0.85, RMSE=74.25 kg•hm-2, NRMSE=9.27%).

Invasions are often dominated by one or a small number of genotypes, yet the underlying factors driving invasions are poorly understood. The chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica first decimated the North American chestnut, and a more recent outbreak threatens European chestnut stands. To unravel the chestnut blight invasion of southeastern Europe, we sequenced 230 genomes of predominantly European strains. Genotypes outside of the invasion zone showed high levels of diversity with evidence for frequent and ongoing recombination. The invasive lineage emerged from the highly diverse European genotype pool rather than a secondary introduction from Asia or North America. The expansion across southeastern Europe was mostly clonal and is dominated by a single mating type, suggesting a fitness advantage of asexual reproduction. Our findings show how an intermediary, highly diverse bridgehead population gave rise to an invasive, largely clonally expanding pathogen. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antifungal Activity; Article; Asexual Reproduction; Binding Site; Biodiversity; Biogeography; Blight; Chestnut; Copy Number Variation; Cryphonectria Parasitica; Dna Extraction; Europe; Finite Element Analysis; Gene Deletion; Gene Frequency; Gene Mapping; Gene Ontology; Gene Structure; Genetic Recombination; Genetic Variability; Genetic Variation; Genome-wide Association Study; Genotype; Haplotype; Human; Infectious Agent; Kosovo; Machine Learning; Mating Type; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Mycosis; Mycovirus; Nonhuman; North American; Oocyte Maturation; Phenotype; Phylogenetic Tree; Phylogeny; Plant Gene; Principal Component Analysis; Protein Phosphorylation; Rna Sequence; Sequence Alignment; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Whole Genome Sequencing; Ascomycetes; Fagaceae; Fungal Genome; Fungal Mating Type Gene; Genetics; Introduced Species; Microbiology; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Ascomycota; Genes, Mating Type, Fungal; Genetic Variation; Genome, Fungal; Introduced Species; Plant Diseases","antifungal activity; Article; asexual reproduction; binding site; biodiversity; biogeography; blight; chestnut; copy number variation; Cryphonectria parasitica; DNA extraction; Europe; finite element analysis; gene deletion; gene frequency; gene mapping; gene ontology; gene structure; genetic recombination; genetic variability; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; genotype; haplotype; human; infectious agent; Kosovo; machine learning; mating type; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; mycosis; mycovirus; nonhuman; North American; oocyte maturation; phenotype; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; plant gene; principal component analysis; protein phosphorylation; RNA sequence; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing; Ascomycetes; Fagaceae; fungal genome; fungal mating type gene; genetics; introduced species; microbiology; pathogenicity; plant disease; Ascomycota; Genes, Mating Type, Fungal; Genetic Variation; Genome, Fungal; Introduced Species; Plant Diseases",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102694857

The vgg16 pre-trained network is considered for the identification of paddy leaf diseases and nitrogen status estimation. Here, two strategies are carried out to identify images: transfer learning and deep feature extraction. The deep feature extraction approach is combined with a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images. The transfer learning approach of vgg16 for identifying four types of leaf diseases and prediction of nitrogen status results in 79.86% and 84.88% accuracy. Again, the deep features of Vgg16 and SVM results for identifying four types of leaf diseases and prediction of nitrogen status have achieved an accuracy of 97.31% and 99.02%, respectively. Besides, a framework is suggested for monitoring of paddy field remotely based on IoT and deep learning. The suggested prototype’s superiority is that it controls temperature and humidity like the state-of-the-art and can monitor the additional two aspects, such as detecting nitrogen status and diseases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Learning; Iot; Monitoring; Paddy Field; Sensor; Smart Field; Extraction; Feature Extraction; Humidity Control; Image Processing; Internet Of Things; Nitrogen; Support Vector Machines; Transfer Learning; Essential Nutrients; Hot Topics; Leaf Disease; Nitrogen Status; Paddy Fields; Per Capita; State Of The Art; Temperature And Humidities; Deep Learning,Extraction; Feature extraction; Humidity control; Image processing; Internet of things; Nitrogen; Support vector machines; Transfer learning; Essential nutrients; Hot topics; Leaf disease; Nitrogen status; Paddy fields; Per capita; State of the art; Temperature and humidities; Deep learning,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100473115

Over-and-under-application of N fertilizers not only limits crop productivity but also leads to negative environment impacts. With such a dilemma, a feasible solution is to match N supply with crop needs across time and space. Hyperspectral remote sensing has been gradually regarded as a cost-effective alternative to traditional destructive field sampling and laboratory testing for crop N status determination. Hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) and linear nonparametric regression have been the dominant techniques used to estimate crop N status. Machine learning algorithms have gradually exerted advantages in modelling the non-linear relationships between spectral data and crop N. Physically-based methods were rarely used due to the lack of radiative transfer models directly involving N. The existing crop N retrieval methods rely heavily on the relationship between chlorophyll and N. The underlying mechanisms of using protein as a proxy of N and crop protein retrieval from canopy hyperspectral data need further exploration. A comprehensive survey of the existing N-related hyperspectral VIs was made with the aim to provide guidance in VI selection for practical application. The combined use of feature mining and machine learning algorithms was emphasized in the overview. Some feature mining methods applied in the field of classification and chemometrics might be adapted for extracting crop N-related features. The deep learning algorithms need further exploration in crop N status assessment from canopy hyperspectral data. Finally, the major challenges and further development direction in crop N status assessment were discussed. The overview could provide a theoretical and technical support to promote applications of hyperspectral remote sensing in crop N status assessment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop N Status; Feature Mining; Hyperspectral Remote Sensing; Machine Learning Algorithm; N-related Hyperspectral Vegetation Index; Agricultural Modeling; Crop Plant; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Fertilizer Application; Ndvi; Remote Sensing; Satellite Data; Soil Nitrogen,agricultural modeling; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; fertilizer application; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite data; soil nitrogen,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100400054

Rapid and accurate acquisition of information about large plant populations is critical for monitoring plant health and dissecting the underlying genetic traits. In recent years, high‐throughput phenotyping technology has benefitted immensely from both remote sensing and machine learning. Simultaneous use of multiple sensors (e.g., high‐resolution RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)) allows a range of spatial and spectral resolutions depending on the trait in question. Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning methodology have emerged as powerful tools for extracting useful biological information from image data. Together, these tools allow the evaluation of various morphological, structural, biophysical, and biochemical traits. In this review, we focus on the recent development of phenomics approaches in strawberry farming, particularly those utilizing remote sensing and machine learning, with an eye toward future prospects for strawberries in precision agriculture. The research discussed is broadly categorized according to strawberry traits related to (1) fruit/flower detection, fruit maturity, fruit quality, internal fruit attributes, fruit shape, and yield prediction; (2) leaf and canopy attributes; (3) water stress; and (4) pest and disease detection.

Over the years, many sugarcane yield monitoring approaches have been developed and tested, but its use is still limited. One option is to use data generated by the sugarcane harvester provided in the controller area network (CAN), which allows getting the messages related to the harvester operation. Our goal was to train and to test random forest (RF), multiple linear regression (MLR), and artificial neural network (ANN) using CAN data available on the on-board computer of the harvester. All predictive models were trained and tested using the main engine parameters: fuel consumption, engine rotation, engine power, and specific fuel consumption (SFC) as data input. A scale yield monitor was installed on the harvester elevator to provide the georeferenced yield data. The yield prediction accuracy of the predictive models using the four parameters was compared. All models followed the observed sugarcane yield and recognized the changes over the time of data collection. The MLR and ANN models have a higher error of prediction in the extreme values of yield. Over the testing time, the ANN underestimated the sugarcane yield, and the RF prediction by the engine parameters of the harvester was coming closest to the observed yield. The best results for predicting sugarcane yield by engine parameters were obtained from the RF model with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 5.6%, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.0 Mg ha−1. The MLR and ANN models have a MAPE of 7.8% and 5.6%, respectively. All the variables were necessary for a better performance of the models; however, SFC was the most important variable for predicting sugarcane yield. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Can Data; Precision Agriculture; Yield Monitor; Agricultural Robots; Control System Synthesis; Decision Trees; Engines; Errors; Forecasting; Harvesters; Linear Regression; Machine Learning; Mean Square Error; Neural Networks; Controller Area Network; Error Of Predictions; Machine Learning Approaches; Multiple Linear Regressions; Predictive Models; Root Mean Square Errors; Specific Fuel Consumption; Sugarcane Harvesters; Predictive Analytics; Accuracy Assessment; Agricultural Land; Artificial Neural Network; Crop Yield; Error Analysis; Fuel Consumption; Machine Learning; Parameterization; Real Time; Rotation; Sugar Cane; Varanidae,Agricultural robots; Control system synthesis; Decision trees; Engines; Errors; Forecasting; Harvesters; Linear regression; Machine learning; Mean square error; Neural networks; Controller area network; Error of predictions; Machine learning approaches; Multiple linear regressions; Predictive models; Root mean square errors; Specific fuel consumption; Sugarcane harvesters; Predictive analytics; accuracy assessment; agricultural land; artificial neural network; crop yield; error analysis; fuel consumption; machine learning; parameterization; real time; rotation; sugar cane; Varanidae,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098958257

The data and methods they used may not be transferable to other crops and locations. On the other hand, operational large-scale systems, such as the European Commission's MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), do not use machine learning. Machine learning is a promising method especially when large amounts of data are being collected and published. We combined agronomic principles of crop modeling with machine learning to build a machine learning baseline for large-scale crop yield forecasting. The baseline is a workflow emphasizing correctness, modularity and reusability. For correctness, we focused on designing explainable predictors or features (in relation to crop growth and development) and applying machine learning without information leakage. We created features using crop simulation outputs and weather, remote sensing and soil data from the MCYFS database. We emphasized a modular and reusable workflow to support different crops and countries with small configuration changes. The workflow can be used to run repeatable experiments (e.g. early season or end of season predictions) using standard input data to obtain reproducible results. The results serve as a starting point for further optimizations. In our case studies, we predicted yield at regional level for five crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, sugar beet, potatoes) and three countries (the Netherlands (NL), Germany (DE), France (FR)). We compared the performance with a simple method with no prediction skill, which either predicted a linear yield trend or the average of the training set. We also aggregated the predictions to the national level and compared with past MCYFS forecasts. The normalized RMSE (NRMSE) for early season predictions (30 days after planting) were comparable for NL (all crops), DE (all except soft wheat) and FR (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower). For example, NRMSE was 7.87 for soft wheat (NL) (6.32 for MCYFS) and 8.21 for sugar beet (DE) (8.79 for MCYFS). In contrast, NRMSEs for soft wheat (DE), sugar beet (FR) and potatoes (FR) were twice as much compared to MCYFS. NRMSEs for end of season were still comparable to MCYFS for NL, but worse for DE and FR. The baseline can be improved by adding new data sources, designing more predictive features and evaluating different machine learning algorithms. The baseline will motivate the use of machine learning in large-scale crop yield forecasting. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Yield Prediction; Large-scale Crop Yield Forecasting; Machine Learning; Modularity; Reusability; Beta Vulgaris Subsp.

X. fastidiosa is limited to the xylem tissue and following infection induces extensive plant-derived xylem blockages, primarily in the form of tyloses. Tylose-mediated vessel occlusions are a hallmark of PD, particularly in susceptible V. vinifera. We temporally monitored tylose development over the course of the disease to link symptom severity to the level of tylose occlusion and the presence/absence of the bacterial pathogen at fine-scale resolution. The majority of vessels containing tyloses were devoid of bacterial cells, indicating that direct, localized perception of X. fastidiosa was not a primary cause of tylose formation. In addition, we used X-ray computed microtomography and machine-learning to determine that X. fastidiosa induces significant starch depletion in xylem ray parenchyma cells. This suggests that a signalling mechanism emanating from the vessels colonized by bacteria enables a systemic response to X. fastidiosa infection. To understand the transcriptional changes underlying these phenotypes, we integrated global transcriptomics into the phenotypes we tracked over the disease spectrum. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that considerable transcriptomic reprogramming occurred during early PD before symptom appearance. Specifically, we determined that many genes associated with tylose formation (ethylene signalling and cell wall biogenesis) and drought stress were up-regulated during both Phase I and Phase II of PD. On the contrary, several genes related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were down-regulated during both phases. These responses correlate with significant starch depletion observed in ray cells and tylose synthesis in vessels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Statch; Tylose; Vitis Vinifera; Xylella Fastidiosa; Xylem; Xylem Ray Parenchyma; Cellulose; Methylcellulose; Starch; Cellulose; Starch; Tyloses; Cellulose; Methylcellulose; Starch; Transcriptome; Biosynthesis; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Transcription; Metabolism; Microbiology; Physiology; Plant Disease; Upregulation; Vitis; Xylella; Xylem; Cellulose; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Diseases; Starch; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Up-regulation; Xylem","cellulose; methylcellulose; starch; transcriptome; biosynthesis; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; plant disease; upregulation; Vitis; Xylella; xylem; Cellulose; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Diseases; Starch; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptome; Up-Regulation; Xylem",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096794524

It can be determined by different parameters such as temperature/humidity, soil mineral contents, soil pH level, salinity level, climatic conditions, moisture of the soil, etc. These parameters must meet the optimum level to make a desirable environment to sustain productivity. Failure to provide the required condition from any of the parameters will lead the plant to stress and deteriorate, potentially leading to a loss in productivity. Laborious ways of monitoring the agricultural parameters are inefficient and time-consuming. An automated irrigation system is essential for the proper growth of crops. Excessive watering of crops and crop water dehydration can lead to stresses that affect the growth of plants. Supplying an optimum amount of water is essential for the healthy development of plants. The IoT and artificial intelligence technologies are the most viable alternative solution for traditional yield prediction and irrigation because of the remote accessibility, interoperability, cognitive capability, etc. These technologies aid the farmers in monitoring agricultural parameters remotely from embedded devices, drastically reducing human efforts. It makes farming much efficient and a smarter farming experience and also increases crop productivity exponentially.

They have great nutritional potential and offer more protein and iron than other vegetables. Various diseases, such as early blight, late blight, and others, will attack potato plants and manifest their symptoms in the leaves. If these outbreaks are discovered early and appropriate treatment is taken, the farmer will not suffer significant economic losses. In this article, the suggested computer vision deep learning approach would significantly help in early identification and detection of different potato disease. Many plant diseases have different visual characteristics that may be utilized to accurately identify and classify them. This study describes a potato disease classification method based on computer vision-deep learning combination. The system trains deep convolutional neural networks such as ResNet-152 and InceptionV3 on the Kaggle potato dataset with an accuracy of 98.34% and 95.24% respectively at learning rate of 0.0005.

Accurate forecasting with well-Timed projections is critical, but it is a challenging undertaking owing to various complicated aspects. There are few examples of crops that can be utilized to forecast crop yields like Wheat, peas, rice, pulses, tea, sugar cane, green houses, cotton, soybeans, and corn. Agriculture needs massive datasets and awareness practices. Meteorological conditions, components of soil, management methods, genotype, and their connections are utilized to predict corn yield. Optimal crop growth frequently requires a detailed knowledge of the operational relationships among yield and these interaction parameters, that needs large datasets and difficult algorithms to demonstrate. Several Machine Learning models, Deep Learning models, and Artificial Neural Network methods are used to forecast. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are used to estimate corn production (RNN).

Its starchy roots are a major source of dietary energy for more than 500 million people. It is known to be the highest producer of carbohydrates among staple crops. It is a very resistant crop however it is not immune to all viral and bacterial diseases. Cassava Mosaic Disease alone causes an annual loss of US$ 1.2 to 2.3 billion. It is a very concerning issue hence it is imperative to detect the disease at its early stages. Modern deep learning techniques can be very useful given the need for predicting diseases with high precision. We propose one-such deep learning-based solution involving Convolutional Neural Networks. Our work proposes a “One-vs-All” methodology for solving the task of classifying the four most prevalent types of cassava leaf diseases and healthy cassava leaves. For this we trained five different binary classifiers for the five different classes, each classifier used the Efficient Net B4 model as the base model followed by few fully connected layers. Our final multi-class classifier achieved an accuracy of 85.64% on highly skewed test data.

In this work, a state-of-the-art deep learning technique has been employed for classification and prediction of cassava leaf diseases. Being the second largest producer of carbohydrates in the world, cassava plant has become an important source of calories for people in tropical regions, but it is highly susceptible to viral, bacterial, and fungal attacks resulting in stunted plant growth and hence the yield. So, the aim of the research is to help the farmers quickly identify diseased leaves before they cause any severe damage.

Sessile plants respond to environmental challenges such as salt, drought, temperature, heavy metals at transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional levels through the stress-regulated network of pathways including transcription factors, proteins and the small non-coding endogenous RNAs. Amongs these, the miRNAs have gained unprecedented attention in recent years as key regulators for modulating gene expression in plants under stress. Hence, tailoring of miRNAs and their target pathways presents a promising strategy for developing multiple stress-tolerant crops. Plant stress tolerance has been successfully achieved through the over expression of microRNAs such as Os-miR408, Hv-miR82 for drought tolerance; OsmiR535A and artificial DST miRNA for salinity tolerance; and OsmiR535 and miR156 for combined drought and salt stress. Examples of miR408 overexpression also showed improved efficiency of irradiation utilization and carbon dioxide fixation in crop plants. Through this review, we present the current understanding about plant miRNAs, their roles in plant growth and stress-responses, the modern toolbox for identification, characterization and validation of miRNAs and their target genes including in silico tools, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Various approaches for up-regulation or knock-out of miRNAs have been discussed. The main emphasis has been given to the exploration of miRNAs for development of bioengineered climate-smart crops that can withstand changing climates and stressful environments, including combination of stresses, with very less or no yield penalties. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioengineering; Climate Change; Combined Stress; Crop Improvement; Environmental Stress; Gene Expression; Mirna; Bleomycin; Type Ii Site Specific Deoxyribonuclease; Micrornas; Arf Protein; Bleomycin; Circular Ribonucleic Acid; Dna Directed Rna Polymerase Iii; Exportin 1; Green Fluorescent Protein; Guide Rna; Heavy Metal; Microrna; Rna Binding Protein; Rna Polymerase Ii; Small Interfering Rna; Small Untranslated Rna; Transcription Factor; Transcriptome; Type Ii Site Specific Deoxyribonuclease; Untranslated Rna; Zinc Finger Protein; Agrobacterium; Amaranthus; Anopheles Gambiae; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Artificial Intelligence; Aubergine; Bioengineering; Biogenesis; Bioinformatics; Caenorhabditis Elegans; Carbon Dioxide Fixation; Climate Change; Climate Resilience; Computer Model; Crispr-cas9 System; Crop; Crop Improvement; Drosophila Melanogaster; Drought Stress; Drought Tolerance; Embryo Development; Environmental Stress; Gene Editing; Gene Expression; Gene Overexpression; Germination; Grape; Harvest; High Throughput Sequencing; Irradiation; Jatropha Curcas; Knockout Gene; Machine Learning; Malus Domestica; Morphogenesis; Nicotiana Tabacum; Peroxisome; Physiological Stress; Plant Growth; Plant Immunity; Plant Stress; Populus; Pyrosequencing; Review; Review; Rna Sequence; Salt Tolerance; Tomato; Transgenics; Validation Process; Genetics; Metabolism; Bioengineering; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Gene Editing; Machine Learning; Micrornas","ARF protein; bleomycin; circular ribonucleic acid; DNA directed RNA polymerase III; exportin 1; green fluorescent protein; guide RNA; heavy metal; microRNA; RNA binding protein; RNA polymerase II; small interfering RNA; small untranslated RNA; transcription factor; transcriptome; type II site specific deoxyribonuclease; untranslated RNA; zinc finger protein; Agrobacterium; Amaranthus; Anopheles gambiae; Arabidopsis thaliana; artificial intelligence; aubergine; bioengineering; biogenesis; bioinformatics; Caenorhabditis elegans; carbon dioxide fixation; climate change; climate resilience; computer model; CRISPR-CAS9 system; crop; crop improvement; Drosophila melanogaster; drought stress; drought tolerance; embryo development; environmental stress; gene editing; gene expression; gene overexpression; germination; grape; harvest; high throughput sequencing; irradiation; Jatropha curcas; knockout gene; machine learning; Malus domestica; morphogenesis; Nicotiana tabacum; peroxisome; physiological stress; plant growth; plant immunity; plant stress; Populus; pyrosequencing; review; Review; RNA sequence; salt tolerance; tomato; transgenics; validation process; genetics; metabolism; Bioengineering; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Gene Editing; Machine Learning; MicroRNAs",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120998066

Manual weedicide spray through bag-pack is hazardous to human health. Localized autonomous weedicide spray through aerial spraying units can help save water, weedicide chemical and effect less on human health. Such systems require multi-spectral cues to classify crop, weed, and soil surface. Our focus in this paper is on the detection of weeds in the sugar beet crop, using air-borne multispectral camera sensors, which is considered as an alternative crop to sugarcane to obtain sugar in Pakistan. We developed a new framework for weed identification; a patch-based classification approach as appose to semantic segmentation that is more realistic for real-time intelligent aerial spraying systems. Our approach converts 3-class pixel classification problem into a 2-class crop-weed patch classification problem which in turns improves crop and weed classification accuracy. For classification, we developed a new VGG-Beet convolutional neural network (CNN), which is based on generic VGG16 (visual graphics group) CNN model with 11 convolutional layers. For experiments, we captured a sugar beet dataset with 3-channel multispectral sensor with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 0.2 cm/pixel and a height of 4 meters. For better comparison, we used two publicly available sugar beet crop aerial imagery datasets, captured using a 5-channel multispectral sensor and a 4-Channel multispectral sensor with a ground sampling distance of 1cm and a height of 10 meters. We observed that patch-based method is more robust to different lighting conditions. To produce low cost weed detection system usage of Agrocam sensor is recommended, for higher accuracy Red Edge and Sequoia multispectral sensors with more channels should be deployed. We observed higher crop-weed accuracy and lower testing time for our patch-based approach as compared to U-Net and Deeplab based semantic segmentation networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Autonomous Weed Detection; Deep Learning In Agriculture; Drone Weed Detection; Multispectral Image Processing; Aerial Photography; Antennas; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Health; Image Classification; Multilayer Neural Networks; Real Time Systems; Semantics; Sugar Beets; Weed Control; Classification Accuracy; Classification Approach; Ground Sampling Distances; Image-based Classification; Multi-spectral Cameras; Multispectral Sensors; Pixel Classification; Semantic Segmentation; Crops,Aerial photography; Antennas; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Health; Image classification; Multilayer neural networks; Real time systems; Semantics; Sugar beets; Weed control; Classification accuracy; Classification approach; Ground sampling distances; Image-based classification; Multi-spectral cameras; Multispectral sensors; Pixel classification; Semantic segmentation; Crops,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114761618

This in turn has helped in improving the quality and production of vegetables and fruits. Citrus fruits are well known for their taste and nutritional values. They are one of the natural and well known sources of vitamin C and planted worldwide. There are several diseases which severely affect the quality and yield of citrus fruits. In this paper, a new deep learning based technique is proposed for citrus disease classification. Two different pre-trained deep learning models have been used in this work. To increase the size of the citrus dataset used in this paper, image augmentation techniques are used. Moreover, to improve the visual quality of images, hybrid contrast stretching has been adopted. In addition, transfer learning is used to retrain the pre-trained models and the feature set is enriched by using feature fusion. The fused feature set is optimized using a meta-heuristic algorithm, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The selected features are used for the classification of six different diseases of citrus plants.

Finding optimal irrigation and water resources for crops is necessary to increase the efficiency of water usage. Many optimization approaches maximize crop yield or profit but do not consider the impact on the environment. We propose a machine learning approach based on the crop simulation model WOFOST to assess the crop yield and water use efficiency. In our research, we use weather history to evaluate various weather scenarios. The application of multi-criteria optimization based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) allows users to find the dates and volume of water for irrigation, maximizing the yield and reducing the total water consumption. In the study case, we compared the effectiveness of NSGA-II with Monte Carlo search and a real farmer’s strategy. We showed a decrease in water consumption simultaneously with increased sugar-beet yield using the NSGA-II algorithm. Our approach yielded a higher potato crop than a farmer with a similar level of water consumption. The NSGA-II algorithm received an increase in yield for potato crops, but water use efficiency remained at the farmer’s level. NSGA-II used water resources more efficiently than the Monte Carlo search and reduced water losses to the lower soil horizons. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Machine Learning; Multi-objective Optimization; Sustainable Agriculture; Water Use Efficiency; Agricultural Robots; Crops; Efficiency; Genetic Algorithms; Irrigation; Monte Carlo Methods; Multiobjective Optimization; Soils; Sugar Beets; Turing Machines; Water Supply; Crop Simulation Model; Impact On The Environment; Machine Learning Approaches; Multicriteria Optimization; Non Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm Ii (nsga Ii); Nsga-ii Algorithm; Optimization Approach; Water Use Efficiency; Water Resources,Agricultural robots; Crops; Efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Irrigation; Monte Carlo methods; Multiobjective optimization; Soils; Sugar beets; Turing machines; Water supply; Crop simulation model; Impact on the environment; Machine learning approaches; Multicriteria optimization; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); NSGA-II algorithm; Optimization approach; Water use efficiency; Water resources,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111436572

A common practice within the field is to acquire and present images of a number of different conidia, expressing a fluorescent fusion protein of interest, at various stages of infectious development, therein providing a representative “snapshot” of the population at a given point in time. Furthermore, these images typically show only a single focal plane through the specimen (2D) and therefore lack, often valuable, volumetric information. While this approach has its advantages, the continuous imaging of (multiple) single conidia in three dimensions (3D), and over time (4D), can provide additional insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of fluorescent fusion proteins, and the subcellular structures and compartments they label, in living cells. Here we describe our typical workflow for the 4D live-cell imaging of appressorium morphogenesis in vitro using two-color widefield fluorescence microscopy and briefly outline some important considerations for strain construction, and downstream image processing and visualization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Appressoria; Deconvolution; Fluorescence; Imaging; Live-cell Imaging; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Microscopy; Fungal Proteins; Fusion Protein; Fungal Protein; Autofluorescence; Cell Culture; Cell Isolation; Data Visualization; Deconvolution; Fluorescence Imaging; Fluorescence Microscopy; Four-dimensional Imaging; Gene Deletion; Image Processing; Image Registration; In Vitro Study; Light Intensity; Live Cell Imaging; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Morphogenesis; Mycelium; Nonhuman; Photoperiodicity; Signal Noise Ratio; Sporogenesis; Surface Property; Ascomycetes; Fungus Spore; Genetics; Magnaporthe; Oryza; Plant Disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Morphogenesis; Optical Imaging; Plant Diseases; Spores, Fungal","fusion protein; fungal protein; autofluorescence; cell culture; cell isolation; data visualization; deconvolution; fluorescence imaging; fluorescence microscopy; four-dimensional imaging; gene deletion; image processing; image registration; in vitro study; light intensity; live cell imaging; Magnaporthe oryzae; morphogenesis; mycelium; nonhuman; photoperiodicity; signal noise ratio; sporogenesis; surface property; Ascomycetes; fungus spore; genetics; Magnaporthe; Oryza; plant disease; Ascomycota; Fungal Proteins; Morphogenesis; Optical Imaging; Plant Diseases; Spores, Fungal",Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109974161

Thus, the detection of plant diseases using sensors that can be mounted on aerial vehicles is in the interest of farmers to support decision-making in integrated pest management and to breeders for selecting tolerant or resistant genotypes. This paper investigated the detection of Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), caused by Cercospora beticola in sugar beet using RGB imagery. We proposed an approach to tackle the CLS detection problem using fully convolutional neural networks, which operate directly on RGB images captured by a UAV. This efficient approach does not require complex multi-or hyper-spectral sensors, but provides reliable results and high sensitivity. We provided a detection pipeline for pixel-wise semantic segmentation of CLS symptoms, healthy vegetation, and background so that our approach can automatically quantify the grade of infestation. We thoroughly evaluated our system using multiple UAV datasets recorded from different sugar beet trial fields. The dataset consisted of a training and a test dataset and originated from different fields. We used it to evaluate our approach under realistic conditions and analyzed its generalization capabilities to unseen environments. The obtained results correlated to visual estimation by human experts significantly. The presented study underlined the potential of high-resolution RGB imaging and convolutional neural networks for plant disease detection under field conditions. The demonstrated procedure is particularly interesting for applications under practical conditions, as no complex and cost-intensive measuring system is required. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Robotics; Cercospora Leaf Spot; Cnns; Phenotyping; Plant Disease Detection; Rgb Images; Semantic Segmentation; Uav-based Monitoring; Agricultural Robots; Convolutional Neural Networks; Fertilizers; Macroinvertebrates; Sugar Beets; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Agricultural Robotics; Cercospora; Cercosporum Leaf Spot; Disease Detection; Leaf Spots; Phenotyping; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Detection; Rgb Images; Semantic Segmentation; Uav-based Monitoring; Semantic Segmentation,Agricultural robots; Convolutional neural networks; Fertilizers; Macroinvertebrates; Sugar beets; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural robotics; Cercospora; Cercosporum leaf spot; Disease detection; Leaf spots; Phenotyping; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; RGB images; Semantic segmentation; UAV-based monitoring; Semantic Segmentation,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106711253

Improving crop yields not only helps farmers but also seeks to address global problems such as food shortages. Predictions can be made taking into account forecasts of climate, soil and its mineral content, moisture, crop historic performance, rainfall and others. Crop Data from six states of India for five crops from 2009–2016 has been used for training and validation of different machine learning regression algorithms to produce a comprehensive study of crop yield estimate. The yields are estimated using Linear models, Support Vector Regressor, K Neighbors Regressor, Tree-based models, Ensemble models and Shallow Neural Networks with R-squared score for evaluation. Test accuracy showed promising results in ensemble models and neural networks. Extra Trees Regressor is the best model with Mean Absolute Error of 351.10 and maximum accuracy of 99.95%.

Meanwhile, with the development of sensor hardware equipment and machine learning technology, smart agriculture has become an important transformation direction of traditional agriculture. In this study, we are committed to the analysis and processing of sensor data collected in plant factories and we model crop development as an optimization problem with respect to certain parameters, such as yield and environmental impact, which can be optimized in an automated way. More exactly, we utilize a Markov decision process to characterize crop development, then propose a deep reinforcement learning based optimization algorithm for improved crop productivity. Several simulation experiments were carried out to optimize the yield of sugar beet in plant factories. The experimental results show that this method has a good effect and makes reasonable use of the data obtained by sensors, and provides agricultural experts with a road to more sustainable agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deep Reinforcement Learning; Plant Factory; Sensor Data Mining; Smart Agriculture; Yield Optimization; Agricultural Robots; Climate Change; Crops; Deep Learning; Digital Storage; Environmental Impact; Markov Processes; Optimization; Population Statistics; Privacy By Design; Sugar Beets; Sugar Industry; Crop Productivity; Machine Learning Technology; Markov Decision Processes; Optimization Algorithms; Optimization Problems; Population Growth; Smart Agricultures; Sustainable Agriculture; Reinforcement Learning,Agricultural robots; Climate change; Crops; Deep learning; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Markov processes; Optimization; Population statistics; Privacy by design; Sugar beets; Sugar industry; Crop productivity; Machine learning technology; Markov Decision Processes; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Population growth; Smart agricultures; Sustainable agriculture; Reinforcement learning,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102489881

Unrestricted use of herbicide for weed removal alters biodiversity and cause environmental pollution. Instead, identifying weed-infested regions can aid selective chemical treatment of these regions. Advances in analyzing farm images have resulted in solutions to identify weed plants. However, a majority of these approaches are based on supervised learning methods which requires huge amount of manually annotated images. As a result, these supervised approaches are economically infeasible for the individual farmer because of the wide variety of plant species being cultivated. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based semi-supervised approach for robust estimation of weed density and distribution across farmlands using only limited color images acquired from autonomous robots. This weed density and distribution can be useful in a site-specific weed management system for selective treatment of infected areas using autonomous robots. In this work, the foreground vegetation pixels containing crops and weeds are first identified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based unsupervised segmentation. Subsequently, the weed infected regions are identified using a fine-tuned CNN, eliminating the need for designing hand-crafted features. The approach is validated on two datasets of different crop/weed species (1) Crop Weed Field Image Dataset (CWFID), which consists of carrot plant images and the (2) Sugar Beets dataset. The proposed method is able to localize weed-infested regions a maximum recall of 0.99 and estimate weed density with a maximum accuracy of 82.13%. Hence, the proposed approach is shown to generalize to different plant species without the need for extensive labeled data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Networks; Computer Vision; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Neural Networks; Precision Agriculture; Resnet; Segmentation; Semi-supervised Learning; Unsupervised Learning; Weeds; Biodiversity; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Deep Learning; Learning Systems; Precision Agriculture; Robots; Semi-supervised Learning; Sugar Beets; Chemical Treatments; Distribution Estimation; Environmental Pollutions; Maximum Accuracies; Robust Estimation; Selective Treatment; Supervised Learning Methods; Unsupervised Segmentation; Agricultural Robots,Biodiversity; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Learning systems; Precision agriculture; Robots; Semi-supervised learning; Sugar beets; Chemical treatments; Distribution estimation; Environmental pollutions; Maximum accuracies; Robust estimation; Selective treatment; Supervised learning methods; Unsupervised segmentation; Agricultural robots,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101471180

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cameras and photogrammetry techniques provide methods to quickly capture the plant canopy structure at field scale. The goal of this study was to determine how to use the point clouds produced by the photogrammetry process to estimate the yield and nutritive value of alfalfa throughout its growth cycle. During the 2017 growing season, weekly measurements were taken of 1 m2 quadrats (~20 per week, 325 total) in a field of alfalfa managed for forage production. Measurements in each quadrat included manual measurements of maximum and average height, weed presence, disease damage, insect damage, maturity level, stand plant density, and many images of the quadrat from a UAV. After processing to remove outliers, the canopy heights from the photogrammetry point clouds were largely Gaussian distributions. Models were developed using supervised machine learning to estimate yield and nutritive values, including acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and crude protein (CP), with different numbers of predictor (input) variables. Simple models with two predictor variables were only based on the mean and standard deviation of the heights of the photogrammetry point cloud. The models with three predictor variables added average field maturity level. Finally, the models with six predictor variables added weed presence, insect damage, and disease damage. A linear regression with all interaction terms was found to be the best type of model for predicting yield with six variables. For all other outputs and numbers of predictor variables, a Gaussian random process (GRP) model was best. The models improved with additional predictor variables, so the six-variable models were best able to predict yield and nutritive value. The R2 values for the six-variable models for predicting yield, ADF, NDF, and CP were 0.81, 0.81, 0.78, and 0.79, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Alfalfa; Machine Learning; Nutritive Value; Photogrammetry; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Yield; Antennas; Cultivation; Gaussian Distribution; Photogrammetry; Random Processes; Supervised Learning; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Acid Detergent Fiber; Forage Production; Gaussian Random Process; Manual Measurements; Mean And Standard Deviations; Neutral Detergent Fiber; Predictor Variables; Supervised Machine Learning; Forecasting; Alfalfa; Crop Yield; Food Quality; Growth Rate; Lidar; Satellite Data; Unmanned Vehicle; Hexapoda; Medicago Sativa,Antennas; Cultivation; Gaussian distribution; Photogrammetry; Random processes; Supervised learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Acid detergent fiber; Forage production; Gaussian random process; Manual measurements; Mean and standard deviations; Neutral detergent fiber; Predictor variables; Supervised machine learning; Forecasting; alfalfa; crop yield; food quality; growth rate; lidar; satellite data; unmanned vehicle; Hexapoda; Medicago sativa,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099298055

In this study, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery were used in combination with climate, soil and elevation data to predict field-level sugarcane yield across the multiple sugar mill areas in the Wet Tropics of Australia at different time steps over four consecutive growing seasons (2016–2019). A total of ≈1400 field-level measurements were used to train predictive machine learning models of cane yield (t/ha), commercial cane sugar (CCS, %), sugar yield (t/ha), crop varieties and ratoon numbers. We compared the predictive performance of models based on both satellite imagery only and a fusion of satellite imagery with climate, soil and topographical information. Randomized search on hyperparameters was the method used to optimize and identify the most accurate decision tree-based machine model. Overall, gradient boosting was the most accurate method for predicting sugarcane attributes. The analysis resulted in cane yield, CCS and sugar yield predicted at the field level with R2 of up to 0.51 (RMSE = 16 t/ha), 0.63 (RMSE = 1 %) and 0.62 (RMSE = 2 t/ha) as soon as four months before the harvest season. It was also found that sugarcane varieties could be mapped with an accuracy of up to 73.4 %, while the differentiation of planted and ratoon crops exhibited the lowest accuracy of 45.4 %. Using a novel SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to explain the output of our machine learning models we found that Sentinel-2 derived spectral indices were the most important in predicting cane yield as well as differentiating sugarcane varieties and ratoon numbers. In contrast, climate and elevation derived predictors were the most important in predicting CCS and sugar yield. At the whole sugar mill area level, spatially averaged field-level results predicted mill area cane yield, CCS and sugar yield with R2 of 0.75 (RMSE = 4.6 t/ha), 0.80 (RMSE = 0.6 %) and 0.77 (RMSE = 1 t/ha).

One of the basic objectives of agricultural production is to gain maximum crop yield at low cost. The yield and subsequent profit can be enhanced by detecting and managing the issues related to crop yield indicators in early stage.

The technique of textural feature analysis and morphological scanning is applied to sugar beet plant in this paper. At last, KNN classifier is applied which can classify weed plant from field crop. The results of the weed detection are analyzed in terms of accuracy and execution time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Knn Classifier; Textural Features; Weed Detection,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092174960

The various areas under rice cultivation in India include the jade green shaded rice cultivated in the eastern regions, dry rice fields in southern regions, etc. The country is one of the world’s massive brown and white rice producers. The total yield in the year 2009 declined almost from 99.18 million tons to a total of just 89.14 million tons which affected the overall decrease in the crop yields as well as the financial outcome of the farmers. So, detecting rice diseases will help in lessening the adverse effects of the natural imbalance. Rice is one of the staple foods in India. Therefore, it becomes the main crop with the largest area under rice cultivation. As India is a tropical country, it benefits crop production as the crop needs hot and humid conditions for its efficient growth. Rice plants are grown in regions that receive heavy rainfall every year. For proper yield the crop requires an overall temperature of around 25 ºC and a steady rainfall of more than 0.1mm. India being a country with extreme climatic conditions and increasing pollution cannot meet the production demand for the crops due to growing diseases and abnormalities. This paper proposes a method to detect whether a rice crop is healthy or unhealthy using Convolutional neural networks, its various architectures, and probabilistic neural networks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Convolutional Neural Network; Feedforward Neural Network; Hyperparameter Tuning; Logical Regression; Probabilistic Neural Network; Rice Disease Prediction; Agricultural Robots; Computation Theory; Convolutional Neural Networks; Cultivation; Intelligent Computing; Rain; Silicate Minerals; Agricultural Economy; Climatic Conditions; Eastern Regions; Humid Conditions; Probabilistic Neural Networks; Production Demand; Rice Cultivation; Tropical Countries; Crops,Agricultural robots; Computation theory; Convolutional neural networks; Cultivation; Intelligent computing; Rain; Silicate minerals; Agricultural economy; Climatic conditions; Eastern regions; Humid conditions; Probabilistic neural networks; Production demand; Rice cultivation; Tropical countries; Crops,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091067712

Given the recent commercialization of low-cost multispectral cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and advances in machine learning techniques, prediction systems for crop characteristics can be more precisely developed using machine learning techniques. Therefore, the model performances for predicting wheat grain yield and protein content between the machine learning algorithms based on spectral reflectance and plant height (e.g. random forest and artificial neural network) and the traditional linear regression based on vegetation indices were compared. Although the machine learning approaches based on reflectance could not improve the grain yield prediction accuracy, they have great potential for development in predicting protein content. The linear regression model based on a 2-band enhanced vegetation index was capable of predicting the yield with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 972 kg ha−1. The random forest model based on reflectance was capable of predicting the protein content with an RMSE of 1.07%. The reflectance may have been linearly correlated with total biomass; thus, it was also linearly correlated with grain yield. There was a nonlinear relationship between the grain yield and protein content, which may have resulted in the higher model performance of the machine learning approaches in predicting protein content. However, this relationship would be variable according to the environment and agronomic practice. Further, field-scale research is required to assess how this relationship can be varied and affect the model generality, particularly when predicting protein content. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Machine Learning; Multispectral Camera; Protein; Uav; Winter Wheat; Yield,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090976677

In order to contribute to maintaining the productivity of tomato plants, the use of technology can be an alternative to be applied to the cultivation of tomato plants. This study applies image processing techniques to detect the texture of affected leaf using gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) extraction and color moment using convolutional neural network (CNN) method. Among the diseases that often occur in tomato leaf are late blight, Septoria spot, bacterial spot, target spot, early blight, leaf curl, spider mites, two spotted spider mites, and leaf mold. In this study, a combination of GLCM-color moment and CNN method was chosen because of its reliability in identifying and classifying plant diseases compared to only using CNN.

Further chromatin characterization revealed associations with features such as H3 Lys-27 methylated histones (H3K27me3) and accessible DNA. Machine learning trained on chromatin data identified twice as much LS DNA as previously recognized, which was validated through orthogonal analysis, and we propose to refer to this DNA as adaptive genomic regions.

The small secretory proteins, explicitly known as effector proteins, are one of the prime mechanisms of host manipulation utilized by the pathogen to disarm the host. Several effector proteins are known to translocate from fungus to the plant cell for host manipulation. Many fungal effectors have been identified using genomic, transcriptomic, and bioinformatics approaches. Most of the effector proteins are devoid of any conserved signatures, and their prediction based on sequence homology is very challenging, therefore by combining the sequence consensus based upon machine learning features, multiple tools have also been developed for predicting apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors. Various post-genomics approaches like transcriptomics of virulent isolates have also been utilized for identifying active consortia of effectors. Significant progress has been made in understanding biotrophic effectors; however, most of it is underway due to their complex interaction with host and complicated recognition and signaling networks.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), and MP5 regression tree model were used to evaluate the grain yield response. All the methods identified fertilizer application and environmental factors as the main variables that explained 80% of the variance in grain yields. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer (NF) application was the major factor that influenced the grain yield in all methods. Farmyard manure slightly influenced the grain yield with no NF application in the ANOVA and M5P regression tree. While sources of environmental factors were unmeasured in the ANOVA test, they were quantified in detail in the LMM and M5P model. The LMM and M5P model identified the cumulative number of freezing days in December as the main climate-based determinant of the grain yield variation. Additionally, the temperature in October, the cumulative number of freezing days in February, the yield of the preceding crop, and the total nitrogen in the soil were determinants of the grain yield in both models. Apart from the common determinants that appeared in both models, the LMM additionally showed precipitation in June and the cumulative number of days in July with temperatures above 30◦C, while the M5P model showed soil organic carbon as an influencing factor of the grain yield. The ANOVA results provide only the main factors affecting the WW yield. The LMM had a better predictive performance compared to the M5P, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute errors. However, they were richer regressors than the ANOVA. The M5P model presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured by the LMM model. Hence, the use of different methods can strengthen the statement of the analysis, and thus, the co-use of the LMM and M5P model should be considered, especially in large databases involving multiple variables. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fertilizer; Linear Mixed-effects Models; Long-term Field Experiment; M5p Machine Learning Algorithm; Weather; Winter Wheat Yield,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109068900

Approximately, the pod of mature groundnut contains 1–5 seeds with 57% of oil and 25% of protein content. The oil obtained from the groundnut is widely used for cooking and losing body weight, and its fats are widely used for making soaps. The groundnut cultivation is affected by different kinds of diseases such as fungi, viruses, and bacteria. Hence, these diseases affect the leaf, root and stem of the groundnut plant and it leads to heavy loss in yield. Moreover, the enlarger number of diseases affects the leaf and root-like Alternaria, Pestalotiopsis, Bud necrosis, tikka, Phyllosticta, Rust, Pepper spot, Choanephora, early and late leaf spot.

However, the yield of these citrus crops is often reduced due to the damage of various pests and diseases.

It is of note that the performance of these selected models degraded as the size of the target object in the image decreased. To adapt to scale changes, a new feature reuse method named bridge connection was developed. With the help of bridge connections, the accuracy of baseline networks was improved at little additional computation cost. The proposed BridgeNet-19 achieved the highest classification accuracy (95.47%), followed by the pre-trained VGG-19 (95.01%) and VGG-19 with bridge connections (94.73%). The use of bridge connections also strengthens the flexibility of sensors for image acquisition.

This study investigates the utilisation of drone remote sensing for managing and monitoring silage grass swards. In northern countries, grass swards are fertilised and harvested three times per season when aiming to maximise the yield. Information about the grass quantity and quality is necessary to optimise these operations. Our objectives were to investigate and develop machine-learning techniques for estimating these parameters using drone photogrammetry and spectral imaging. Trial sites were established in southern Finland for the primary growth and regrowth of grass in the summer of 2017. Remote-sensing datasets were captured four times during the primary growth season and three times during the regrowth period. Reference measurements included fresh and dry biomass and several quality parameters, such as the digestibility of organic matter in dry matter (the D-value), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), indigestible neutral detergent fibre (iNDF), water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), the nitrogen concentration (Ncont) in dry matter (DM) and nitrogen uptake (NU). Machine-learning estimators based on random forest (RF) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods were trained using the reference measurements and tested using independent test datasets. The best results for the biomass estimation, nitrogen amount and digestibility were obtained when using hyperspectral and 3D data, followed by the combination of multispectral and 3D data. During the training process, the best normalised root-mean-square errors (RMSE%) were 14.66% for the dry biomass and 12% for fresh biomass; the best RMSE% values for NU, the D-value and NDF were 13.6%, 1.98% and 3% respectively. For the primary growth, the accuracies of all quality parameters were better than 20% with the independent test datasets; for the regrowth, the estimation accuracies of the D-value, iNDF, NDF, Ncont and NU were better than 20%. The results showed that drone remote sensing was an excellent tool for the efficient and accurate management of silage production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biomass; Digestibility; Drone; Grass Sward; Hyperspectral; Machine Learning; Multiple Linear Regression; Neutral Detergent Fibre; Nitrogen; Photogrammetry; Precise Agriculture; Random Forest; Agricultural Robots; Biomass; Decision Trees; Drones; Ecology; Learning Algorithms; Linear Regression; Machine Learning; Mean Square Error; Nitrogen; Photogrammetry; Remote Sensing; Spectrometry; Spectroscopy; Imaging Spectrometry; Machine Learning Techniques; Multiple Linear Regression Method; Neutral Detergent Fibre; Nitrogen Concentrations; Reference Measurements; Root Mean Square Errors; Water-soluble Carbohydrates; Parameter Estimation; Biomass; Crop Yield; Grass; Growing Season; Growth; Machine Learning; Organic Matter; Photogrammetry; Remote Sensing; Silage; Spectrometry; Sward; Finland,Agricultural robots; Biomass; Decision trees; Drones; Ecology; Learning algorithms; Linear regression; Machine learning; Mean square error; Nitrogen; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Spectrometry; Spectroscopy; Imaging spectrometry; Machine learning techniques; Multiple linear regression method; Neutral detergent fibre; Nitrogen concentrations; Reference measurements; Root mean square errors; Water-soluble carbohydrates; Parameter estimation; biomass; crop yield; grass; growing season; growth; machine learning; organic matter; photogrammetry; remote sensing; silage; spectrometry; sward; Finland,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084320831

Therefore, sugarcane growers and food companies are seeking ways to address the concerns related to sugarcane crop yield and health. In this study, a spatial and spectral analysis on the peak growth stage of the sugarcane fields in Bundaberg, Queensland, Australia is performed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE) derived from high-resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) images and multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. Two topics are chosen for this study: 1) the difference and correlation between NDVI and NDRE that are commonly used to estimate Leaf Area Index, a common crop parameter for the assessment of crop yield and health stages; 2) the impact of spatial resolution on the systematic difference in the abovementioned two Vegetation Indices (VIs). The statistical correlation analysis between the WV2 and UAV images produced correlation coefficients of 0.68 and 0.71 for NDVI and NDRE, respectively. In addition, an overall comparison of the WV2 and UAV-derived VIs indicated that the UAV images produced a better accuracy than the WV2 images because UAV can effectively distinguish various status of vegetation owing to its high spatial resolution. The results illustrated a strong positive correlation between NDVI and NDRE, each derived from the WV2 and UAV images, and the correlation coefficients were 0.81 and 0.90, respectively, i.e.The correlation between NDVI and NDRE is higher in the UAV images than the WV2 images. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Leaf Area Index (lai); Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (ndre); Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ndvi); Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (uav); Vegetation Indices (vis); Worldview-2 (wv2); Antennas; Correlation Methods; Crops; Image Analysis; Image Resolution; Remote Sensing; Spectrum Analysis; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Aerial Vehicle; Leaf Area Index; Normalized Difference Red Edge Index; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Normalized Differences; Red Edge; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Vegetation Index; Worldview-2; Vegetation,Antennas; Correlation methods; Crops; Image analysis; Image resolution; Remote sensing; Spectrum analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Leaf area index; Normalized difference red edge index; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized differences; Red edge; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vegetation index; Worldview-2; Vegetation,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090349016

The mRNA isoforms of the same gene can have dramatically different functions. Despite the functional importance of mRNA isoforms, very little has been done to annotate their functions.

However, for the limited imaging equipment and the complex imaging environment of hyperspectral images, the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images is still relatively low, which limits the application of hyperspectral images. So, studying the data characteristics of hyperspectral images deeply and improving the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images is an important prerequisite for accurate interpretation and wide application of hyperspectral images. The purpose of this paper is to deal with super-resolution of the hyperspectral image quickly and accurately, and maintain the spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral image, makes the spectral separability of the substrate in the original image remains unchanged after super-resolution processing. This paper first learns the mapping relationship between the spectral difference of low-resolution hyperspectral image and the spectral difference of the corresponding high-resolution hyperspectral image based on multiple scale convolutional neural network, Thus, apply this mapping relationship to the input low-resolution hyperspectral image generally, getting the corresponding high resolution spectral difference. Constrained space by using the image of reconstructed spectral difference, this requires the low-resolution hyperspectral image generated by the reconstructed image is to be close to the input low-resolution hyperspectral image in space, so that the whole process becomes a closed circulation system where the low-resolution hyperspectral image generation of high-resolution hyperspectral images, then back to low-resolution hyperspectral images. This innovative design further enhances the super-resolution performance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the hyperspectral image super-resolution method based on convolutional neural network improves the input image spatial information, and the super-resolution performance of the model is above 90%, which can maintain the spectral information well. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Hyperspectral Image; Multi-scale Deep Convolutional Network; Quality Research; Super-resolution Processing; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Hyperspectral Imaging; Image Resolution; Mineral Exploration; Optical Resolving Power; Photomapping; Radar Target Recognition; Spectroscopy; Convolutional Networks; Data Characteristics; Hyper-spectral Imageries; Image Super Resolutions; Mapping Relationships; Spectral Characteristics; Spectral Differences; Spectral Separability; Image Enhancement,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Hyperspectral imaging; Image resolution; Mineral exploration; Optical resolving power; Photomapping; Radar target recognition; Spectroscopy; Convolutional networks; Data characteristics; Hyper-spectral imageries; Image super resolutions; Mapping relationships; Spectral characteristics; Spectral differences; Spectral separability; Image enhancement,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087280714

These secondary metabolites can be treated as the resources of industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fuels. Plants are also crucial targets for metabolic engineers to produce necessary secondary metabolites. Metabolic engineering of both microorganism and plants also contributes towards drug discovery. In order to implement advanced metabolic engineering techniques efficiently, metabolic engineers should have detailed knowledge about cell physiology and metabolism. Principle behind methodologies: Genome-scale mathematical models of integrated metabolic, signal transduction, gene regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks along with experimental validation can provide such knowledge in this context. Incorporation of omics data into these models is crucial in the case of drug discovery. Inverse metabolic engineering and metabolic control analysis (MCA) can help in developing such models. Artificial intelligence methodology can also be applied for efficient and accurate metabolic engineering. Conclusion: In this review, we discuss, at the beginning, the perspectives of metabolic engineering and its application on microorganism and plant leading to drug discovery. At the end, we elaborate why inverse metabolic engineering and MCA are closely related to modern metabolic engineering. In addition, some crucial steps ensuring efficient and optimal metabolic engineering strategies have been discussed. Moreover, we explore the use of genomics data for the activation of silent metabolic clusters and how it can be integrated with metabolic engineering.

Plant genes conferring complete resistance against S. sclerotiorum have not been reported. Instead, plant populations challenged by S. sclerotiorum exhibit a continuum of partial resistance designated as quantitative disease resistance (QDR). Because of their complex interplay and their small phenotypic effect, the functional characterization of QDR genes remains limited. How broad host range necrotrophic fungi manipulate plant programmed cell death is for instance largely unknown. Here, we designed a time-resolved automated disease phenotyping pipeline enabling high-throughput disease lesion measurement with high resolution, low footprint at low cost. We could accurately recover contrasted disease responses in several pathosystems using this system. We used our phenotyping pipeline to assess the kinetics of disease symptoms caused by seven S. sclerotiorum isolates on six A. thaliana natural accessions with unprecedented resolution. Large effect polymorphisms common to the most resistant A. thaliana accessions identified highly divergent alleles of the nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat gene LAZ5 in the resistant accessions Rubezhnoe and Lip-0. We show that impaired LAZ5 expression in laz5.1 mutant lines and in A. thaliana Rub natural accession correlate with enhanced QDR to S. sclerotiorum. These findings illustrate the value of time-resolved image-based phenotyping for unravelling the genetic bases of complex traits such as QDR.

Recently, it was reported that the Balsam pear is exposed to many diseases namely, powdery mildew, gray leaf spot, gummy stem blight, Phyllosticta leaf spot, etc. The aim of the study was an automatic identification method for Balsam pear leaf diseases based on improved Faster R-CNN. 1 204 pictures of balsam pear leaves were photographed under sunlight which included the healthy balsam pear leaf as control and infected leaves with powdery mildew; gray leaf spot; gummy stem blight, and Phyllosticta leaf spot. The data were accumulation and rotating and flipping randomly. Finally, 10 627 pictures were obtained as the experimental groups. The design of the experiment was carried out as 9 564 pictures used as a training group, 1 435 pictures of the training group were used as a detection group. and 1 063 pictures were used as the experimental groups. The residual-structure convolutional neural network, ResNet-50, was used as the feature extraction network of Faster R-CNN. Two classic networks, ZF-Net and VGG-16, were compared to extract features that showed significant results, proving whether the proposed approach performed well or not. The pre-trained ImageNet model for transfer learning was joined to the network, which saved computing and time costs. Feature maps obtained from the feature extraction network were input to the Region proposal network for proposals, which included a series of anchors, scores, classification loss, and bounding-box regression loss. Finally, feature maps and proposals were sent to R-CNN for the ultimate accurate location. The obtained results indicated that the performance of the original model was not good because balsam pear leaf diseases were complicated in color, texture, and shape. The feature extraction networks were likely to miss some diseases of the balsam pear leaf diseases because their forms were tiny, and some took up a few pixels that made it difficult to distinguish diseases. To solve the difficulty of detecting the small targets of balsam pear leaf diseases, Faster R-CNN was modified to increase the different sizes of bounding boxes, along with the introduction of the feature pyramid networks to ResNet-50. Feature pyramid networks helped to extract feature maps from every block in ResNet-50, which contained an accurate location and strong semantic information. Feature pyramid networks then handed it over to the Region proposal network to get more accurate proposals to make object recognition. As a result, the experiment showed that the performance of the trained model using the original ResNet-50 was better than that used ZF-Net or VGG-16 as a feature extraction network, and the mean average precision was 78.85%. The average precision of healthy balsam pear leaves, powdery mildew, gray leaf spot, gummy stem blight, and Phyllosticta leaf spot were 88.24%, 75.73%, 51.75%, 72.00% and 72.15%, respectively. The mean average precision for the feature pyramid networks' final model was 0.863 9, which is 7.54% higher than before. The average precision of healthy balsam pear leaves, powdery mildew, gray leaf spot, gummy stem blight, and Phyllosticta leaf spot were 89.24%, 81.48%, 83.31%, 88.62%, and 89.24%, respectively, and the average precision of gray leaf spot increased the stain by more than 16%.

Selecting and breeding of varieties of sugar beet based on plant phenotyping are the key factors for the development of sugar beet industry on a large-scale cultivation. In China, sugar beet was widely planted in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly for poverty alleviation of farmers living in border areas and ethnic minority areas. The type of beet root with great different genotypes directly determines the sugar yield and mechanization efficiency in modern agriculture. The traditional classification of beet root type depends mainly on manual separation, and thereby greatly limits industry production and breeding of the sugar beet due to heavy workload and relatively large errors. In order to meet the requirements of high-throughput analysis, a three-dimensional (3D) phenotyping technique with multi-view images was recently developed to facilitate the classification of fruit and vegetable with high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, the beet roots with 207 genotypes were selected as experimental materials. Multi-view images were obtained by moving mobile phone around beet root. Three-dimensional point clouds were reconstructed in 3DF Zephyr Aerial software, which can restore position and direction from a dataset of multi-views images to extract for the matching feature points between each pair of images. After the postprocessing of the matching images, including noise reduction, rotating and segment, the detailed features of beet root shape, color, and texture can be achieved in the 3D point cloud. Ten phenotypic parameters can be used to clarify the morphological characteristics of beet roots, the maximum diameter, root length, convex hull volume, top projection area, compactness, convex index, convex angle, distal root end ratio, proximal root end ratio and root taper index. There was a good agreement between the measured maximum diameter and root length, with coefficient of determination R2 > 0.95. The K-medoids clustering algorithm with high stability was selected to classify the beet root into four groups. Group 1, namely as cone beet root, indicates that the maximum root diameter located at the middle of the root body. Group 2, namely as hammer beet root, shows the shortest body of root, the smallest root head ration while larger root tail ration. Group 3, namely as wedge beet root, has the maximum diameter of root body close to the root head, whereas, the width of root from head to tail gradually decreased. Group 4, namely as long wedge beet root, has longer root body than that in group 3, wider root head and smaller root tail. The reduction rate of root body from head to tail was the greatest. Based on the combination of phenotypic traits and experts' knowledge, Group 1 (cone beet root) and Group 3 (wedge beet root) were recommended due to their high sugar yield, medium root length and moderate proportion. After adjusting the categories by the experts as the true values, five prediction models were established to discriminate beet root type, including linear discrimination, random forest, support vector machine, decision tree, and naive Bayes. The results showed that the prediction accuracies of the five models were above 70.0%, where accuracy of random forest reached 81.4%. These results demonstrated that 3D point cloud reconstructed by multi-view image sequences can be used for the identification of beet root shape, and thereby to effectively improve the yield prediction of sugar beet and the selection of high-quality beet varieties. Since 207 genotypes have been selected for the classification of root types during this time, much more genotypes at different environments can be expected to enrich the 3D phenotyping library, and thereby further improve the accuracy of classification. This finding can provide a potential practical basis for the beet root type screening and breeding. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Beet; Classification; Image Procession; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Root Type; Three Dimensional Point Cloud; Agricultural Robots; Antennas; Clustering Algorithms; Color Matching; Cultivation; Decision Trees; Efficiency; Forecasting; Image Enhancement; Image Reconstruction; Image Segmentation; Machinery; Noise Abatement; Predictive Analytics; Random Forests; Sugar Beets; Support Vector Machines; Textures; Accuracy Of Classifications; Arid And Semi-arid Regions; Coefficient Of Determination; Experimental Materials; High-throughput Analysis; Large Scale Cultivations; Morphological Characteristic; Three-dimensional Point Clouds; Sugar Industry,Agricultural robots; Antennas; Clustering algorithms; Color matching; Cultivation; Decision trees; Efficiency; Forecasting; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Machinery; Noise abatement; Predictive analytics; Random forests; Sugar beets; Support vector machines; Textures; Accuracy of classifications; Arid and semi-arid regions; Coefficient of determination; Experimental materials; High-throughput analysis; Large scale cultivations; Morphological characteristic; Three-dimensional point clouds; Sugar industry,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088363707

Roots are able to uptake soil phosphate from the immediate root area, thus creating a nutrient depletion zone. Many plants are able to exploit phosphate from beyond this root nutrient depletion zone through symbiotic association with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF). Here we characterise the relationship between root architecture, AMF association and low phosphate tolerance in strawberries. The contrasting root architecture in the parental strawberry cultivars 'Redgauntlet' and 'Hapil' was studied through a mapping population of 168 progeny. Low phosphate tolerance and AMF association was quantified for each genotype to allow assessment of the phenotypic and genotypic relationships between traits. Results: A ""phosphate scavenging"" root phenotype where individuals exhibit a high proportion of surface lateral roots was associated with a reduction in root system size across genotypes. A genetic correlation between ""root system size"" traits was observed with a network of pleiotropic QTL found to represent five ""root system size"" traits. By contrast, average root diameter and the distribution of roots appeared to be under two discrete methods of genetic control. A total of 18 QTL were associated with plant traits, 4 of which were associated with solidity that explained 46% of the observed variation. Investigations into the relationship between AMF association and root architecture found that a higher root density was associated with greater AMF colonisation across genotypes. However, no phenotypic correlation or genotypic association was found between low phosphate tolerance and the propensity for AMF association, nor root architectural traits when plants are grown under optimal nutrient conditions. Conclusions: Understanding the genetic relationships underpinning phosphate capture can inform the breeding of strawberry varieties with better nutrient use efficiency. Solid root systems were associated with greater AMF colonisation. However, low P-tolerance was not phenotypically or genotypically associated with root architecture traits in strawberry plants. Furthermore, a trade-off was observed between root system size and root architecture type, highlighting the energetic costs associated with a ""phosphate scavenging"" root architecture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Amf; Image Analysis; Length Distribution; Macronutrients; Network; Qtl; Rhizotron; Solidity; Symbiont; Trade-off; Phosphate; Phosphates; Phosphate; Anatomy And Histology; Fragaria; Genetics; Genotype; Glomeromycota; Metabolism; Microbiology; Mycorrhiza; Physiology; Plant Root; Polyploidy; Genotype; Mycorrhizae; Phosphates; Plant Roots; Polyploidy,phosphate; anatomy and histology; Fragaria; genetics; genotype; Glomeromycota; metabolism; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; plant root; polyploidy; Genotype; Mycorrhizae; Phosphates; Plant Roots; Polyploidy,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083097686

Standardized reference evapotranspiration (ET) and location specific crop coefficients are used to estimate crop evapotranspiration. However, precise information on crop coefficient (Kc) is a major impediment in semiarid environments. Field studies were conducted during two seasons of 2015 and 2016 in clay soils to determine crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients (Kc) of sugarcane for semiarid India.The experimental area was cultivated with irrigation applied at 7–10 days interval by a drip irrigation system in addition to rainfall and the irrigation scheduling was based on field water balance approach. The crop evapotranspiration was determined by field water balance, reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by the Penman-Monteith approach while crop coefficient were computed through the standard FAO-56 methodology.On an annual basis, the total reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) were 1318−1426 mm and 1291−1388 mm respectively. Two years average sugarcane crop evapotranspiration estimated by field water balance method was 1339 mm year−1. The irrigation water requirement andeffective rainfall was 991 mm year-1 and 424 mm year-1 respectively. Two years results showed that there was a notable symmetry between Kc obtained from field water balance measurements and FAO-56 reported Kc. The determined Kc values for tillering, grand growth and maturity stages of sugarcane were 0.70, 1.20 and 0.78, respectively. The Kc values were found 25.5 %, 4 % and 20.4 % less during the tillering, grand growth and maturity stage respectively over the FAO-56 Kc values. The 2nd order polynomial equation was fitted with crop coefficient as the dependent variables and ratio of days after transplanting to total crop period as the independent variable.

Computer vision-based techniques have been used successfully in the last decades, to detect and classify the plants diseases. This paper deals with the identification and classification of diseases in grape leaves by using artificial bee colony (ABC) based feature selection. Initially the input images are applied with pre-processing steps which eliminate noises and background of the images. The features of color, texture and shape are extracted. ABC based attribute selection is used to find the optimal feature set. The selected features are given to the support vector machine classifier for foliar disease detection of grapes.

In Malaysia rice productivity is steadily increasing and Malaysia’s self-sufficiency level of rice is at 72%. Quantification of rice parameters, such as Vegetation Indices (VIs) and Backscatter Coefficients (σ°) is important in rice yield productivity modelling. Yield modelling is the best tool for rice crop and productivity management. Various VIs and backscatter coefficients are being used to monitor crop growth and to predict and estimate yield before harvesting date. Previous studies shows most analysis use satellite images close to harvesting date of rice crop. The aims of this study is to develop rice yield modelling through on VIs i.e. Normalize Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) and backscatter coefficients (σ°) for 30 plots of rice fields in Sawah Sempadan, Selangor, Malaysia rice granary area. Other purposes of this study are to examine the correlation of the VIs and σ° with the reported yield and study the effectiveness of using Optical and SAR data for rice yield modelling. The first method of this modelling involves data processing of Landsat 8 OLI and Radarsat2 imageries to obtain the VIs of rice crop and the second part present regression analysis of VIs with the reported yield of rice crop. The yield prediction equation gives good correlation (R2) result for LAI which is R2=0.81, compared to NDVI (R2=0.61) and SAVI (R2=0.71) for Landsat 8 dataset. While the analysis of Radarsat-2 gave very low correlation (R2=0.10). In this limited study, it was observed that SAVI gives a better result for modelling yield at the time of the productive stage. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Backscatter Coefficients (σ°); Landsat-8 Oli & Radarsat-2; Rice Yield Modelling; Vegetation Indices (vi's); Backscattering; Crops; Data Handling; Forestry; Image Analysis; Optical Correlation; Productivity; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Vegetation; Backscatter Coefficients; Good Correlations; Harvesting Dates; Predict And Estimate; Productivity Management; Satellite Images; Vegetation Index; Yield Prediction; Space-based Radar,Backscattering; Crops; Data handling; Forestry; Image analysis; Optical correlation; Productivity; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Backscatter coefficients; Good correlations; Harvesting dates; Predict and estimate; Productivity management; Satellite images; Vegetation index; Yield prediction; Space-based radar,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107237221

Continuous improvements in accuracy by eliminating all the radiometric and geometric errors, as well as the use of sophisticated statistical techniques goad to effective and optimized decision making. Although previous studies found mathematical relationships between final crop yield and different forms of spectral indices all around the world, few studies conducted in small areas. The relation of crop growth stages and sugarcane yield after applying the atmospheric and geometric corrections is also not considered by the researchers in the past. This study aims to estimate the sugar content of the sugarcane crop grown in a small area with machine learning models. The process based on correlation analysis to identify of the best periods for the reliable and efficient estimation of the crops is presented in this study. The study has been carried out in the Khedli Minor area near Bahadrabad District Haridwar Uttarakhand, which belongs to the Himalayan foothill region. The performance evaluation of the models has been analyzed using Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The minimum value of RMSE =1.52 has been found with the cost parameter C=1 and Sigma = 0.1 for the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. Compared with the other models, the SVR model exhibit better performances on Brix estimation based on the multitemporal vegetation indices. Although, this study exhibits some promising results in the yield estimation, a more generalized model can be developed with additional inputs from physical characteristics such as temperature, precipitation and soil moisture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Crop Yield; Ndvi; Reflectance; Sugarcane; Crops; Decision Making; Errors; Image Processing; Knowledge Management; Machine Learning; Mean Square Error; Soil Moisture; Support Vector Regression; Vegetation; Continuous Improvements; Efficient Estimation; Machine Learning Models; Mathematical Relationship; Physical Characteristics; Root Mean Square Errors; Statistical Techniques; Support Vector Regression (svr); Estimation,Crops; Decision making; Errors; Image processing; Knowledge management; Machine learning; Mean square error; Soil moisture; Support vector regression; Vegetation; Continuous improvements; Efficient estimation; Machine learning models; Mathematical relationship; Physical characteristics; Root mean square errors; Statistical techniques; Support vector regression (SVR); Estimation,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083499288

With the advances in recent technologies, Smart farming allows to utilize Internet of things (IoT) to assist the farmers for reducing the wastages and improving the productivity. At the same time, Citrus is a main source for vitamin C and gets affected by citrus diseases that spoil the fruit quality. In this paper, an IoT based Smart Farming model is presented by the use of improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier named as IPSO-CNN technique. The proposed method initially captures the plant images using IoT devices and stores the data in cloud. The proposed IPSO-CNN model gets executed on the cloud to identify and classify the presence of plant diseases. For experimentation, a benchmark citrus fruits image dataset named Citrus Image Gallery dataset is employed.

The idea is to use swarm technology (one main drone rest 3–4 worker drones) in the agricultural field to solve problems related to farming. Today AI sensors have made the work for humans very easy. Similarly, in this project, drones will be equipped with different sensors like hyperspectral, thermal and LiDAR. These sensors will be used to solve problems like weed detection, drought condition detection, water stress, nitrogen content etc. Hyperspectral sensors are more precise and accurate than multispectral sensors in detecting minerals and vegetation, which will help in maintaining the plant nutrient status, identifying plant disease, water quality assessment and surface chemical composition. Thermal sensors measure the surface temperature of land and objects and create their thermal images for further analysis [1]. Then theses created thermal images are analyzed for identifying any heat stress, water stress, and plant metabolism from their canopy temperature. LiDAR sensors are laser equipped and use a laser beam to create 3D models of crops to identify drought stress and to optimize water use. LiDAR sensors are used to measure the vegetation level, the topography of the ground underneath.

Bipolaris sorokiniana is the main pathogenic fungus in leaf spot disease. In this study, B. sorokiniana from wheat leaf (W-B. sorokiniana) showed much stronger pathogenicity toward wheat than endophytic B. sorokiniana from Pogostemon cablin (P-B. sorokiniana). The transcriptomes and metabolomics of the two B. sorokiniana strains and transcriptomes of B. sorokiniana-infected wheat leaves were comparatively analyzed. In addition, the expression levels of unigenes related to pathogenicity, toxicity, and cell wall degradation were predicted and validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Results indicated that pathogenicity-related genes, especially the gene encoding loss-of-pathogenicity B (LopB) protein, cell wall-degrading enzymes (particularly glycosyl hydrolase-related genes), and killer and Ptr necrosis toxin-producing related unigenes in the W-B. sorokiniana played important roles in the pathogenicity of W-B. sorokiniana toward wheat. The down-regulation of cell wall protein, photosystem peptide, and rubisco protein suggested impairment of the phytosynthetic system and cell wall of B. sorokiniana-infected wheat. The up-regulation of hydrolase inhibitor, NAC (including NAM, ATAF1 and CUC2) transcriptional factor, and peroxidase in infected wheat tissues suggests their important roles in the defensive response of wheat to W-B. sorokiniana. This is the first report providing a comparison of the transcriptome and metabolome between the pathogenic and endophytic B. sorokiniana strains, thus providing a molecular clue for the pathogenic mechanism of W-B. sorokiniana toward wheat and wheat’s defensive response mechanism to W-B. sorokiniana. Our study could offer molecular clues for controlling the hazard of leaf spot and root rot diseases in wheat, thus improving wheat yield in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bipolaris Sorokiniana; Cell Wall-degrading Enzymes; Comparative Transcriptome; Defensive Response; Pathogenicity; Toxin Producing; Mycotoxins; Genomic Dna; Hydrolase Inhibitor; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Mycotoxin; Transcriptome; Article; Bioinformatics; Bipolaris Sorokiniana; Controlled Study; Dna Synthesis; Down Regulation; Enzyme Degradation; Fungal Cell Culture; Fungal Plant Disease; Fungal Strain; Fungal Virulence; Fungus Isolation; Gene Expression; Gene Ontology; High Performance Liquid Chromatography; Image Analysis; Leaf Spot; Metabolomics; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration; Molecular Mechanics; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Phylogenetic Tree; Plant Pathogen Interaction; Protein Expression; Rna Extraction; Rna Sequence; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Thin Layer Chromatography; Transcriptomics; Upregulation; Wheat Leaf Spot Disease; Ascomycetes; Cell Wall; Comparative Study; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Metabolism; Microbiology; Molecular Genetics; Mycelium; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Plant Genome; Secondary Metabolism; Ultrastructure; Wheat; Ascomycota; Cell Wall; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Ontology; Genome, Plant; Metabolomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Mycelium; Mycotoxins; Plant Diseases; Secondary Metabolism; Transcriptome; Triticum","genomic DNA; hydrolase inhibitor; reactive oxygen metabolite; mycotoxin; transcriptome; Article; bioinformatics; Bipolaris sorokiniana; controlled study; DNA synthesis; down regulation; enzyme degradation; fungal cell culture; fungal plant disease; fungal strain; fungal virulence; fungus isolation; gene expression; gene ontology; high performance liquid chromatography; image analysis; leaf spot; metabolomics; minimum inhibitory concentration; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; phenotype; phylogenetic tree; plant pathogen interaction; protein expression; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; scanning electron microscopy; thin layer chromatography; transcriptomics; upregulation; wheat leaf spot disease; Ascomycetes; cell wall; comparative study; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; mycelium; pathogenicity; plant disease; plant genome; secondary metabolism; ultrastructure; wheat; Ascomycota; Cell Wall; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Ontology; Genome, Plant; Metabolomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Mycelium; Mycotoxins; Plant Diseases; Secondary Metabolism; Transcriptome; Triticum",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076189943

The genetic basis of resistance to this disease in pepper is not well known. This study aimed to identify BW resistance markers in pepper. Analysis of the dynamics of bioluminescent R. solanacearum colonization in reciprocal grafts of a resistant (BVRC 1) line and a susceptible (BVRC 25) line revealed that the resistant rootstock effectively suppressed the spreading of bacteria into the scion. The two clear-cut phenotypic distributions of the disease severity index in 440 F2 plants derived from BVRC 25 × BVRC 1 indicated that a major genetic factor as well as a few minor factors that control BW resistance. By specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing combined with bulked segregant analysis, two adjacent resistance-associated regions on chromosome 10 were identified. Quantitative trait (QTL) mapping revealed that these two regions belong to a single QTL, qRRs-10.1.

A cluster of five predicted R genes and three defense-related genes, which are located in close proximity to the significant markers ID10-194305124 or ID10-196208712, are important candidate genes that may confer BW resistance in pepper. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capsicum Annuum; Linkage Mapping; Qtl; Ralstonia Solanacearum; Rootstock; Slaf-seq; Plant Proteins; Agar Gel Electrophoresis; Article; Bioluminescence; Capsicum Annuum; Controlled Study; Disease Severity; Dna Extraction; Dna Sequence; Female; Gene Amplification; Gene Deletion; Gene Insertion; Gene Insertion Sequence; Gene Ontology; Gene Sequence; Genotyping Technique; Image Analysis; Male; Mathematical Model; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Plant Disease; Plant Gene; Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping; Ralstonia Solanacearum; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Chromosomal Mapping; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Metabolism; Microbiology; Pathogenicity; Pepper; Physiology; Procedures; Quantitative Trait Locus; Plant Protein; Capsicum; Chromosome Mapping; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Quantitative Trait Loci","agar gel electrophoresis; Article; bioluminescence; Capsicum annuum; controlled study; disease severity; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; female; gene amplification; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene insertion sequence; gene ontology; gene sequence; genotyping technique; image analysis; male; mathematical model; nonhuman; phenotype; plant disease; plant gene; quantitative trait locus mapping; Ralstonia solanacearum; real time polymerase chain reaction; chromosomal mapping; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; pepper; physiology; procedures; quantitative trait locus; plant protein; Capsicum; Chromosome Mapping; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Quantitative Trait Loci",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075419277

Agricultural technology needs to be quick in implementation and easy in adoption. Farmers usually follow a method called crop mutation after every consequent crop yield. The crop mutation allows the soil to regain the minerals that were used by the crop previously and use the left over minerals for cultivating the new crop. To know if the soil has reached the point where it is unfit to yield the particular crop, farmer has to experience a loss in yield. One financial year for a farmer is very crucial to accept the loss. This paper implements a that would help in maintaining the soil fertility consistently. This method is tradi tionally implemented in many countries where the change in crop is done after a loss in yield for cultivating the same crop continuously. There are three soil parameters that come into consideration when we have to predict the soil quality.

However, a comparison of the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) and Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) models has not been previously used to optimize management practices for spring maize in northeast China. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of the DSSAT and DNDC models in simulating maize growth and soil C & N dynamics and analyse their weaknesses and strengths based on a 7-year spring maize study in northeast China; and to explore the optimal management practices for improving maize production and nitrogen use efficiency under 20-year climate variability. Both DNDC and DSSAT exhibited “good” to “excellent” performance in simulating maize yield, above-ground biomass and plant N uptake for ecological intensification with N fertilizer (EI-N) and farmers’ practice with N fertilizer (FP-N) treatments based on percent bias (PBIAS) of −10.5–4.2%, a normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE) of 7.5–17.2%, a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.17–0.77 and a d index of agreement (d) of 0.81–0.94. Both models showed “fair” to “good” performance in the same simulation for EI without N fertilizer (EI-N0) and FP without N fertilizer (FP-N0) treatments, but the maize yield simulation was better for the DSSAT model. In addition, the two models provided “fair” performance for N-fertilized treatments to “poor” performance for N-unfertilized treatments in simulations of soil organic carbon (0–0.20 m) and mineral N (0–0.30 m), but the simulations were better for the DNDC model. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the optimum yield and agronomic efficiency were achieved at a planting date of late April to early May, a fertilizer N application rate of 180–210 kg N ha−1 with two timing splits in the DNDC and DSSAT model and a planting density of 7 seeds m−2 in the DSSAT model. This study suggests that comparing the management scenarios of multiple dynamic models is more beneficial to develop best management practices for improving crop production and fertilizer use efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dndc Model; Dssat Model; Maize Growth; Nitrogen Use Efficiency; Sensitivity Analysis; Agronomy; Artificial Intelligence; Crops; Cultivation; Decision Support Systems; Ecology; Efficiency; Fertilizers; Mean Square Error; Organic Carbon; Seed; Sensitivity Analysis; Agrotechnology Transfer; Best Management Practices; Denitrification Decompositions (dndc); Dndc Models; Dssat Models; Nitrogen-use Efficiency; Root Mean Squared Errors; Sustainable Agriculture; Climate Models; Agricultural Modeling; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Decision Support System; Fertilizer Application; Maize; Nutrient Dynamics; Nutrient Use Efficiency; Seasonality; Sensitivity Analysis; Soil Nitrogen; Yield Response; Zea Mays,Agronomy; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Ecology; Efficiency; Fertilizers; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Seed; Sensitivity analysis; Agrotechnology transfer; Best management practices; Denitrification decompositions (DNDC); DNDC models; Dssat models; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Root mean squared errors; Sustainable agriculture; Climate models; agricultural modeling; crop production; crop yield; decision support system; fertilizer application; maize; nutrient dynamics; nutrient use efficiency; seasonality; sensitivity analysis; soil nitrogen; yield response; Zea mays,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071990483

This paper deals with the effects of SP on the plant water status, vegetative growth, yield and fruit quality of two Prunus persica fruit trees of different ages: mature (peach trees) and young (nectarine trees). Pruning provided a total of 8 and 12 kg dry matter tree−1, being the SP contribution of 56% and 34%, of young and mature Prunus trees, respectively. Tree cover (obtained with zenithal image analysis) was significantly lower in the SP treatment, which resulted in an improvement in the plant water status of about 0.30 MPa with respect to WP trees in summer, leading to a reduction in water consumption during periods of highest evaporative demand (postharvest), equivalent to 10% of annual requirements under WP conditions. No significant differences were detected between WP and SP in the yield components studied. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the tree age/size as a key factor for the application of SP in trees grown under commercial conditions. Summer pruning can be considered a sensible cultural practice to mitigate the drought effects in early-maturing Prunus persica, maintaining yield with no extra costs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Nectarine Trees; Peach Trees; Pruning; Tree Age; Water Status; Yield; Crop Improvement; Crop Yield; Deciduous Tree; Drought; Dry Matter; Fruit; Plant Water Relations; Pruning; Summer; Prunus; Prunus Persica; Prunus Persica Nucipersica,crop improvement; crop yield; deciduous tree; drought; dry matter; fruit; plant water relations; pruning; summer; Prunus; Prunus persica; Prunus persica nucipersica,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065017399

Machine learning through computer vision using deep learning techniques provides a solution to solve this problem. This study trained and test a deep learning model consisting of 13,842 sugarcane image dataset of disease infected leaves and healthy leaves achieving an accuracy of 95%.

Citrus is a major plant grown mainly in the tropical areas of the world due to its richness in vitamin C and other important nutrients. The production of the citrus fruit has been widely affected by citrus diseases which ultimately degrades the fruit quality and causes financial loss to the growers. During the past decade, image processing and computer vision methods have been broadly adopted for the detection and classification of plant diseases. Early detection of diseases in citrus plants helps in preventing them to spread in the orchards which minimize the financial loss to the farmers. In this article, an image dataset citrus fruits, leaves, and stem is presented. The dataset holds citrus fruits and leaves images of healthy and infected plants with diseases such as Black spot, Canker, Scab, Greening, and Melanose. Most of the images were captured in December from the Orchards in Sargodha region of Pakistan when the fruit was about to ripen and maximum diseases were found on citrus plants. The dataset is hosted by the Department of Computer Science, University of Gujrat and acquired under the mutual cooperation of the University of Gujrat and the Citrus Research Center, Government of Punjab, Pakistan. The dataset would potentially be helpful to researchers who use machine learning and computer vision algorithms to develop computer applications to help farmers in early detection of plant diseases.

A sustainable crop production requires a limited use of fertilizer and the employment of plant varieties with improved ability to acquire nutrients from soil. To reach these goals, the scientific community aims to understand plant nutrients homeostasis by deciphering the nutrient sensing and signalling mechanisms of plants. Several lines of evidence about the involvement of Ca2+ as the signal of an impaired nutrient availability have been reported. Ca2+ signalling is a tightly regulated process that requires specific protein toolkits to perceive external stimuli and to induce the specific responses in the plant needed to survive. Here, we summarize both older and recent findings concerning the involvement of Ca2+ signalling in the homeostasis of nutrients. In this review, we present new emerging technologies, based on the use of genetically encoded Ca2+ sensors and advanced microscopy, which offer the chance to perform in planta analyses of Ca2+ dynamics at cellular resolution. The harnessing of these technologies with different genetic backgrounds and subjected to different nutritional stresses will provide important insights to the still little-known mechanisms of nutrient sensing in plants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calcium Signalling; Genetically Encoded Calcium Sensors; Microscopy; Mineral Nutrition; Calcium; Calcium; Fertilizers; Soil; Calcium; Cell; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Dietary Mineral; Fertilizer Application; Food Security; Homeostasis; Imaging Method; Malnutrition; Microscopy; Nutrient Availability; Nutrient Dynamics; Sensor; Signaling; Fertilizer; Chemistry; Genetic Procedures; Image Processing; Metabolism; Plant; Procedures; Signal Transduction; Soil; Biosensing Techniques; Calcium; Fertilizers; Homeostasis; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Nutrients; Plants; Signal Transduction; Soil","calcium; cell; crop production; crop yield; dietary mineral; fertilizer application; food security; homeostasis; imaging method; malnutrition; microscopy; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; sensor; signaling; fertilizer; chemistry; genetic procedures; image processing; metabolism; plant; procedures; signal transduction; soil; Biosensing Techniques; Calcium; Fertilizers; Homeostasis; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Nutrients; Plants; Signal Transduction; Soil",Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070323999

Notable differences have been observed in root morphology, root xylem number and area, stomata number, relative water content, proline content, protein and gene expression. In addition, novel automated frameworks based on computer vision algorithms have been employed for high-throughput quantification of xylem using scanning electron microscopy images. Transcriptome analysis has revealed variation in expression of Med37c and RSOsPR10 genes among various rice varieties.

Susceptible plants presented a high level of proteins involved in stress response at the final stages of the infection, whereas resistant plants presented high level of ROS proteins, metabolic proteins, and proteins involved in the immune system process.

The QTL with the highest logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 3.76 was UVBR12-1 on Chromosome 12, containing two genes encoding spectrin beta chain, brain (SPTBN, Glyma.12g088600) and bZIP transcription factor21/TGACG motif-binding 9 (bZIP TF21/TGA9, Glyma.12g088700). Their amino acid sequences did not differ between the mapping parents, but both genes were significantly upregulated by UV-B stress in Buseok but not in Cheongja 3. Among five genes in UVBR6-1 on Chromosome 6, Glyma.06g319700 (encoding a leucine-rich repeat family protein) had two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms differentiating the parental lines. Our findings offer powerful genetic resources for efficient and precise breeding programs aimed at developing resistant soybean cultivars to multiple stresses. Furthermore, functional validation of the candidate genes will improve our understanding of UV-B stress defense mechanisms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain; Bzip Transcription Factor21/tga9; Leucine-rich Repeat Family Protein; Quantitative Trait Loci; Soybean; Spectrin Beta Chain; Stress Defense Signaling; Uv-b Stress Resistance; Transcription Factor; Transcription Factor 12; Unclassified Drug; Abiotic Stress; Allele; Amino Acid Substitution; Article; Biotic Stress; Chromosome 12; Chromosome 6; Controlled Study; Dna Extraction; Exon; Fusarium Solani; Gene Expression; Genetic Analysis; Genetic Linkage; Genotype; Image Analysis; Intron; Leaf Damage; Missense Mutation; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Phenotypic Variation; Phytophthora Sojae; Plant Gene; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Quantitative Trait Locus; Radiosensitivity; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna Sequence; Sclerotinia Sclerotiorum; Sequence Analysis; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Soybean; Ultraviolet B Radiation; Chromosomal Mapping; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Cross; Genetics; Inbreeding; Lod Score; Physiological Stress; Plant Chromosome; Plant Genome; Radiation Response; Radiation Tolerance; Synteny; Ultraviolet Radiation; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Crosses, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genetic Linkage; Genome, Plant; Inbreeding; Lod Score; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Radiation Tolerance; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological; Synteny; Ultraviolet Rays","transcription factor; transcription factor 12; unclassified drug; abiotic stress; allele; amino acid substitution; Article; biotic stress; chromosome 12; chromosome 6; controlled study; DNA extraction; exon; Fusarium solani; gene expression; genetic analysis; genetic linkage; genotype; image analysis; intron; leaf damage; missense mutation; nonhuman; phenotype; phenotypic variation; Phytophthora sojae; plant gene; plant growth; plant leaf; quantitative trait locus; radiosensitivity; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; soybean; ultraviolet B radiation; chromosomal mapping; gene expression regulation; genetic cross; genetics; inbreeding; lod score; physiological stress; plant chromosome; plant genome; radiation response; radiation tolerance; synteny; ultraviolet radiation; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Crosses, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genetic Linkage; Genome, Plant; Inbreeding; Lod Score; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Radiation Tolerance; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological; Synteny; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069268110

Plant viruses evolved to encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that interfere with the function of key components in the silencing pathway. As effectors in the RNA silencing pathway, ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins are targeted by some VSRs, such as that encoded by Turnip crinkle virus (TCV). A VSR-deficient TCV mutant was used to identify AGO proteins with antiviral activities during infection. A quantitative phenotyping protocol using an image-based color trait analysis pipeline on the PlantCV platform, with temporal red, green, and blue imaging and a computational segmentation algorithm, was used to measure plant disease after TCV inoculation. This process captured and analyzed growth and leaf color of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants in response to virus infection over time. By combining this quantitative phenotypic data with molecular assays to detect local and systemic virus accumulation, AGO2, AGO3, and AGO7 were shown to play antiviral roles during TCV infection. In leaves, AGO2 and AGO7 functioned as prominent nonadditive, anti-TCV effectors, whereas AGO3 played a minor role. Other AGOs were required to protect inflorescence tissues against TCV. Overall, these results indicate that distinct AGO proteins have specialized, modular roles in antiviral defense across different tissues, and demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based phenotyping to quantify disease progression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ago3 Protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Argonaute 2 Protein, Arabidopsis; Argonaute Proteins; Capsid Proteins; Zippy Protein, Arabidopsis; Ago3 Protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Protein; Argonaute 2 Protein, Arabidopsis; Argonaute Protein; Capsid Protein; Protein Binding; Zippy Protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; Carmovirus; Disease Resistance; Genetics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Image Processing; Immunology; Metabolism; Mutation; Physiology; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Procedures; Rna Interference; Virology; Arabidopsis Proteins; Argonaute Proteins; Capsid Proteins; Disease Resistance; Host-pathogen Interactions; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Mutation; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Protein Binding; Rna Interference","AGO3 protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis protein; argonaute 2 protein, Arabidopsis; argonaute protein; capsid protein; protein binding; ZIPPY protein, Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; Carmovirus; disease resistance; genetics; host pathogen interaction; image processing; immunology; metabolism; mutation; physiology; plant disease; plant leaf; procedures; RNA interference; virology; Arabidopsis Proteins; Argonaute Proteins; Capsid Proteins; Disease Resistance; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mutation; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Protein Binding; RNA Interference",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069235889

While these advances, combined with machine learning techniques, benefited yield modeling, most of the current literature about data-driven yield modeling has not yet accounted for potential sources of correlation in data, assuming independence between samples. In this scenario, random sampling can lead to correlated samples across sets being used for model evaluation. We implemented a spatially-aware protocol and compared it with the naive approach of assuming independence between samples. The protocols were applied through all the model development pipeline: data splitting for hold-out sets, feature selection, cross-validation for model adjustment and model evaluation. Three different machine learning techniques were used to create models in each protocol. The resulting models were evaluated both in the validation set created by each protocol and in a manually created independent set. This independent set ensured there was no auto-correlation between the samples used for modeling. We showed that assuming independence when modeling yield leads to underestimating model errors and overfit during model adjustment. Despite better error tracking, the model with the smallest error in the test set was not the model with the smallest validation error, suggesting overfit for the model selection. While this effect was small for the spatially-aware protocol, the effect was a lot stronger in the naive protocol. Future efforts in yield modeling should address the effect of spatial auto-correlation and other potential sources of correlation to improve correctness and robustness of the results. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Boosted Regression Trees; Random Forest; Rrelieff; Spatial Clustering; Support Vector Regression; Agricultural Robots; Decision Trees; Machine Learning; Random Forests; Support Vector Regression; Application Of Information Technologies; Boosted Regression Trees; Machine Learning Techniques; Model Development; Rrelieff; Spatial Autocorrelations; Spatial Clustering; Validation Errors; Errors; Agricultural Modeling; Agricultural Technology; Autocorrelation; Cluster Analysis; Crop Yield; Error Analysis; Machine Learning; Model Validation; Regression Analysis; Sampling; Spatial Analysis; Sugar Cane; Support Vector Machine,Agricultural robots; Decision trees; Machine learning; Random forests; Support vector regression; Application of information technologies; Boosted regression trees; Machine learning techniques; Model development; RReliefF; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial clustering; Validation errors; Errors; agricultural modeling; agricultural technology; autocorrelation; cluster analysis; crop yield; error analysis; machine learning; model validation; regression analysis; sampling; spatial analysis; sugar cane; support vector machine,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053716491

Nutrient deficiency is the cause of serious diseases in plant growth, affecting crop yield. In this article, we employed artificial neural network models to recognize, classify, and predict the nutritional deficiencies occurring in tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.). To classify and predict the different macronutrient deficiencies in the cropping process, this paper handles the captured images of the macronutrient deficiency. This deficiency during the fruiting and leafing phases of tomato plant are based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). A total of 571 images were captured with tomato leaves and fruits containing the crop species at the growth stage. Among all images, 80% (461 captured images) were used for the training dataset and 20% (110 captured images) were applied for the validation dataset. In this study, we provide an analysis of two different model architectures based on convolutional neural network for classifying and predicting the nutrient deficiency symptoms. For instance, Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder with the captured images of tomato plant growth under the greenhouse conditions. Moreover, a major type of statistical structure, namely Ensemble Averaging, was applied with two aforementioned predictive models to increase the accuracy of predictive validation. Three mineral nutrients, i.e., Calcium/Ca2+, Potassium/K+, and Nitrogen/N, are considered for use in evaluating the nutrient status in the development of tomato plant with these models. The aim of this study is to predict the nutrient deficiency accurately in order to increase crop production and prevent the emergence of tomato pathology caused by lack of nutrients. The predictive performance of the three models in this paper are validated, with the accuracy rates of 87.273% and 79.091% for Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder, respectively, and with 91% validity using Ensemble Averaging. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Autoencoder; Classification; Deep Learning; Ensemble Averaging; Inception-resnet V2; Nutrient Deficiency; Prediction; Tomato Plant,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067101930

The available literature suggests that there are two types of smut resistance mechanisms: external resistance by physical or chemical barriers and intrinsic internal resistance mechanisms operating at host–pathogen interaction at cellular and molecular levels. The nature of smut resistance mechanisms, however, remains largely unknown. The present study investigated the changes in proteome occurring in two sugarcane varieties with contrasting susceptibility to smut—F134 and NCo310—at whip development stage after S. scitamineum infection. Total proteins from pathogen inoculated and uninoculated (control) leaves were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Protein identification was performed using BLASTp and tBLASTn against NCBI nonredundant protein databases and EST databases, respectively. A total of thirty proteins spots representing differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 16 from F134 and 14 from NCo310, were identified and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. In F134, 4 DEPs were upregulated and nine were downregulated, while, nine were upregulated and three were downregulated in NCo310. The DEPs were associated with DNA binding, metabolic processes, defense, stress response, photorespiration, protein refolding, chloroplast, nucleus and plasma membrane. Finally, the expression of CAT, SOD, and PAL with recognized roles in S. scitamineum infection in both sugarcane verities were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) technique. Identification of genes critical for smut resistance in sugarcane will increase our knowledge of S. scitamineum-sugarcane interaction and help to develop molecular and conventional breeding strategies for variety improvement. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Isr; Proteomics; Rt-qpcr; Smut; Sporisorium Scitamineum; Sugarcane; Catalase; Ethylene; Phosphoenolpyruvate; Pyruvate Phosphate Dikinase; Ribulosebisphosphate Carboxylase; Superoxide Dismutase; Thioredoxin; Ubiquitin; Plant Proteins; Antioxidant; Catalase; Complementary Dna; Cytokinin; Elongation Factor; Ethylene; Heat Shock Protein 70; Nucleic Acid Binding Protein; Phosphoenolpyruvate; Phytohormone; Proteome; Pyruvate Phosphate Dikinase; Ribulosebisphosphate Carboxylase; Superoxide Dismutase; Thioredoxin; Thioredoxin Peroxidase; Translational Elongation Factor; Ubiquitin; Unclassified Drug; Plant Protein; Antifungal Resistance; Article; Chloroplast; Developmental Stage; Dna Binding; Down Regulation; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Enzyme Activity; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fungus; Gene Expression; Hormone Determination; Image Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Nonhuman; Oxidative Stress; Photorespiration; Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis; Protein Analysis; Protein Expression; Protein Refolding; Proteomics; Quantitative Analysis; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna Extraction; Signal Transduction; Smut (plant Disease); Sporisorium Scitamineum; Stress; Sugarcane; Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Two Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis; Upregulation; Gene Expression Regulation; Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption-ionization Mass Spectrometry; Metabolism; Microbiology; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Procedures; Ustilaginales; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-dimensional; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Proteomics; Saccharum; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption-ionization","antioxidant; catalase; complementary DNA; cytokinin; elongation factor; ethylene; heat shock protein 70; nucleic acid binding protein; phosphoenolpyruvate; phytohormone; proteome; pyruvate phosphate dikinase; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; superoxide dismutase; thioredoxin; thioredoxin peroxidase; translational elongation factor; ubiquitin; unclassified drug; plant protein; antifungal resistance; Article; chloroplast; developmental stage; DNA binding; down regulation; endoplasmic reticulum; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fungus; gene expression; hormone determination; image analysis; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; oxidative stress; photorespiration; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein analysis; protein expression; protein refolding; proteomics; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; signal transduction; smut (plant disease); Sporisorium scitamineum; stress; sugarcane; time of flight mass spectrometry; transmission electron microscopy; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; upregulation; gene expression regulation; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; plant disease; procedures; Ustilaginales; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Proteomics; Saccharum; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060947628

Considering that the experimental identification of plant-pathogen PPIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, computationalmethods are emerging as an important strategy to complement the experimentalmethods. In this work, we first evaluated the performance of traditional computationalmethods such as interolog, domain-domain interaction and domain-motif interaction in predicting known plant-pathogen PPIs. Owing to the low sensitivity of the traditionalmethods, we utilized RandomForest to build an interspecies PPI predictionmodel based onmultiple sequence encodings and novel network attributes in the established plant PPI network. Critical assessment of the features demonstrated that the integration of sequence information and network attributes resulted in significant and robust performance improvement. Additionally, we also discussed the influence of Gene Ontology and gene expression information on the prediction performance. TheWeb server implementing the integrated predictionmethod, named InterSPPI, has beenmade freely available at http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/intersppi/index.php. InterSPPI could achieve a reasonably high accuracy with a precision of 73.8% and a recall of 76.6% in the independent test. To examine the applicability of InterSPPI, we also conducted cross-species and proteome-wide plant-pathogen PPI prediction tests. Taken together, we hope this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of the current status of plant-pathogen PPI predictions, and the proposed InterSPPI can become a useful tool to accelerate the exploration of plant-pathogen interactions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature Integration; Machine Learning; Plant-pathogen Interaction; Prediction; Protein-protein Interaction; Arabidopsis Proteins; Plant Proteins; Arabidopsis Protein; Plant Protein; Algorithm; Arabidopsis; Biological Model; Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Genetics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Immunology; Machine Learning; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant; Plant Disease; Plant Immunity; Procedures; Protein Analysis; Protein Database; Statistics And Numerical Data; Algorithms; Arabidopsis Proteins; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Host-pathogen Interactions; Machine Learning; Models, Biological; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Plants; Protein Interaction Mapping","Arabidopsis protein; plant protein; algorithm; Arabidopsis; biological model; biology; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunology; machine learning; metabolism; microbiology; plant; plant disease; plant immunity; procedures; protein analysis; protein database; statistics and numerical data; Algorithms; Arabidopsis Proteins; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Machine Learning; Models, Biological; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Plants; Protein Interaction Mapping",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057310772

In this review we outline the current methods for the prediction of fungal plant pathogenicity effector proteins. Some fungal effectors have been characterised and are represented by conserved motifs or in sequence repositories, however most fungal effectors do not generally exhibit high conservation of amino acid sequence. Therefore various predictive methods have been developed around: general properties, structure, position in the genomic landscape, and detection of mutations including repeat-induced point mutations and positive selection. A combinatorial approach incorporating several of these methods is often employed and candidates can be prioritised by either ranked scores or hierarchical clustering. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fungal Proteins; Fungal Protein; Virulence Factor; Amino Acid Sequence; Bioinformatics; Conserved Sequence; Genomics; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Plant Pathogen Interaction; Point Mutation; Protein Domain; Protein Secretion; Review; Transcriptomics; Biology; Chemistry; Fungus; Genetics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Metabolism; Microbiology; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Sequence Alignment; Virulence; Computational Biology; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Host-pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Sequence Alignment; Virulence,fungal protein; virulence factor; amino acid sequence; bioinformatics; conserved sequence; genomics; machine learning; nonhuman; plant pathogen interaction; point mutation; protein domain; protein secretion; Review; transcriptomics; biology; chemistry; fungus; genetics; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; plant disease; sequence alignment; virulence; Computational Biology; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Sequence Alignment; Virulence,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042122414

In March 2015, Al Jazeera estimated 10.9 million Syrians or almost half the population who have been displaced which has been one of the most severe humanitarian disasters since World War II. Therefore, it is difficult to monitor humanitarian conditions in Syria during the war. Remotely sensed imagery which can record Earth' s surface information from outer space has been proved to be an efficient and objective data source for evaluating armed conflicts. This paper uses Syria two river basins as research areas. Based on the spatial and temporal scales of the study and the complex characteristics of the crop planting structure in Syria, the region has a total of 12 remote sensing images for 19 months between 2010 and 2017 with 456 remote sensing images. The selected TM/OLI image is selected as a suitable data source for the study. Here, 50 km of two river basins and 5 remote sensing images of each month are intercepted, and a total of 120 remote sensing images are taken to process. Combining crop phenology information, using time series NDVI curves, and comparing the similarity of the NDVI time series curve with the reference time series curve of the to-be-segmented pixels, we established the rules and object-oriented classification method to extract the crop planting structure information of Syria and the two river basins between 2010 and 2017. These include mainly crops of sugar beet, cotton, wheat, and orchards, and analyze the impact of the war on changes in the crop planting structure. The main findings and characteristics are as following:(1)When the ground survey sample cannot be obtained, establishing a rule through the existing crop growth process to select crops whose growth process values are in full compliance with the sample, and establishing reference NDVI time series curves of various crops for object-oriented classification.(2)The experimental results show that during the civil war between the two river basins in Syria during the period from 2010 to 2017, large areas of farmland were abandoned, beet, cotton, wheat, and fruit trees were caused by reduced, and crop yields were reduced by 1/2. The are a of abandoned farmland duringthe Civil War is an important indicator of immigration, death, and trauma. This also explains the great damage caused by the war.(3)The range and total area of crops in Syria and the total area extracted from remote sensing imagery in 2010 are similar to those of survey data. This shows that it is feasible to extract Syria's 2017 crop distribution in accordance with the above-mentioned method and ensure the reliability of the results with authe nticity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Multi-temporal Data; Object-oriented Classification; Rule Set; Structure Of Crop Planting; Time Series Ndvi; Classification (of Information); Cotton; Crops; Earth (planet); Image Processing; Military Operations; Orchards; Rivers; Space Optics; Sugar Beets; Surveys; Time Series; Watersheds; Complex Characteristics; Multi-temporal Data; Object Oriented Classification; Remote Sensing Imagery; Remotely Sensed Imagery; Rule Set; Spatial And Temporal Scale; Structure Information; Remote Sensing,Classification (of information); Cotton; Crops; Earth (planet); Image processing; Military operations; Orchards; Rivers; Space optics; Sugar beets; Surveys; Time series; Watersheds; Complex characteristics; Multi-temporal data; Object oriented classification; Remote sensing imagery; Remotely sensed imagery; Rule set; Spatial and temporal scale; Structure information; Remote sensing,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055876773

With the advancement of field technologies however, especially those related to the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or Drones, the quality of available information has increased, making it possible to overcome technological bottlenecks. However, drone technologies have advanced much faster than studies dealing with the treatment and analysis of information, which can represent an obstacle to the complete adoption of such technologies in sugarcane fields. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential for UAV images to assess the degree of canopy closure from different planting approaches and row-spacing treatments applied to sugarcane crop, in order to assess the potential of these tools to predict crop yield. The vegetative growth of the crop was evaluated and the images were obtained at the point of maximum tillering and the inflection point of the biomass accumulation curve. The evaluations included the index; LAI (Leaf Area Index) and GRVI (Green-Red Vegetation Index) obtained by field sensor and UAV, respectively. Because the images from UAV cover the total area, the results revealed that GRVI appears to be much better able to reflect the whole condition of the crop yield (R2 = 0.69) in the field when compared to LAI (R2 = 0.34); demonstrated convincingly by the high spatial resolution capacity of the technology. When integrated, these two indices were able to improve yield estimates by 10% (R2 = 0.79). Images obtained using UAV can represent a low-cost tool for obtaining high-precision remote data that can be used to estimate the agricultural yield of sugarcane fields; and in this way are an effective tool to aid decision making by growers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Antennas; Decision Making; Drones; Agricultural Crops; Agricultural Yields; Biomass Accumulation; Field Technology; High Spatial Resolution; Inflection Points; Vegetation Index; Vegetative Growth; Crops; Agricultural Technology; Assessment Method; Crop Yield; Image Analysis; Precision; Prediction; Sugar Cane; Unmanned Vehicle,Antennas; Decision making; Drones; Agricultural crops; Agricultural yields; Biomass accumulation; Field technology; High spatial resolution; Inflection points; Vegetation index; Vegetative growth; Crops; agricultural technology; assessment method; crop yield; image analysis; precision; prediction; sugar cane; unmanned vehicle,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043677642

The in vitro assays showed that BAS2 was not necessary for vegetative growth but was important for normal asexual reproduction in C. gloeosporioides. Pathogenicity assays suggested that BAS2 was involved in the process of the pathogen penetrating into the host tissue. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that BAS2 showed secretional characteristics in the fungi, and BAS2 mainly function as a cytoplasmic protein after being secreted into the host cell. Extracellular proteomics analysis revealed that BAS2 was required for the secretion of a series of proteins, which were important for the pathogenicity of C. gloeosporioides.

In plants, citrus is used as a major source of nutrients like vitamin C throughout the world. However, ‘Citrus’ diseases badly effect the production and quality of citrus fruits. From last decade, the computer vision and image processing techniques have been widely used for detection and classification of diseases in plants. In this article, we propose a hybrid method for detection and classification of diseases in citrus plants. The proposed method consists of two primary phases; (a) detection of lesion spot on the citrus fruits and leaves; (b) classification of citrus diseases. The citrus lesion spots are extracted by an optimized weighted segmentation method, which is performed on an enhanced input image. Then, color, texture, and geometric features are fused in a codebook. Furthermore, the best features are selected by implementing a hybrid feature selection method, which consists of PCA score, entropy, and skewness-based covariance vector. The selected features are fed to Multi-Class Support Vector Machine (M-SVM) for final citrus disease classification. The proposed technique is tested on Citrus Disease Image Gallery Dataset, Combined dataset (Plant Village and Citrus Images Database of Infested with Scale), and our own collected images database. We used these datasets for detection and classification of citrus diseases namely anthracnose, black spot, canker, scab, greening, and melanose. The proposed technique outperforms the existing methods and achieves 97% classification accuracy on citrus disease image gallery dataset, 89% on combined dataset and 90.4% on our local dataset. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Citrus Diseases; Citrus Fruits; Feature Extraction; Feature Selection; Features Fusion; Classification (of Information); Feature Selection; Image Enhancement; Image Segmentation; Losses; Object Detection; Plants (botany); Support Vector Machines; Textures; % Reductions; Citrus Disease; Economic Loss; Features Extraction; Features Fusions; Features Selection; Image Database; Plant Disease; Vision Processing; Vitamin C; Citrus Fruits; Data Set; Detection Method; Disease; Fruit; Image Classification; Image Processing; Numerical Method; Optimization; Segmentation; Support Vector Machine; Vitamin; Citrus,Classification (of information); Feature Selection; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Losses; Object detection; Plants (botany); Support vector machines; Textures; % reductions; Citrus disease; Economic loss; Features extraction; Features fusions; Features selection; Image database; Plant disease; Vision processing; Vitamin C; Citrus fruits; data set; detection method; disease; fruit; image classification; image processing; numerical method; optimization; segmentation; support vector machine; vitamin; Citrus,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046444985

Several alternatives to oil have emerged, among them the use of plant biomass for fuel. Sugarcane (Saccharum spp L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) have exhibited excellent potential in this regard. These crops are highly efficient in producing carbohydrates which can easily be fermented to produce ethanol. Proper irrigation practices, providing the ideal amount of water that the plant needs to reach its full potential yield, are needed to maximize income from these crops. Sugarcane and corn are of great economic importance to the state of São Paulo, where it is common to irrigate these crops. This research aims to determine conditions for increased productivity and water availability for these crops in the region of Piracicaba, SP, under future climate scenarios. To achieve this goal, two crop simulation models presented in DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer), DSSAT/CANEGRO and CERES-MAIZE, were coupled with the MarkSim model for estimating data for current and future (1982–2012 and 2062–2092, respectively) climate scenarios. Information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was used to generate data for current conditions, as well as future conditions: the A1B − a middle-term scenario which there are a fast economic growth and balance in the use of sources of fossil and non-fossil fuels; the A2 – a pessimistic scenario which there are a heterogeneous world and an oriented regional economic world; and the B1 – a optimistic scenario which there are local solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. Based on these results, for future scenarios, sugarcane cultivar RB86-7515 yield will be reduced by approximately 40% if the cultivars are not genetically improved. To maintain the same yield levels of hybrid corn BR201, these will be necessary to increase irrigation water by 81%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Crop Growth Models; Relative Productivity; Artificial Intelligence; Climate Models; Crops; Decision Support Systems; Economic Analysis; Grain (agricultural Product); Irrigation; Productivity; Regional Planning; Sustainable Development; Water Management; Agrotechnology Transfer; Crop Growth Model; Crop Simulation Model; Future Climate Scenarios; Increased Productivity; Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Changes; Relative Productivity; Social And Environmental; Climate Change; Climate Change; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Cultivar; Economic Growth; Growth Modeling; Hybrid; Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change; Irrigation System; Maize; Sugar Cane; Water Availability; Water Management; Brazil; Piracicaba; Sao Paulo [brazil]; Saccharum; Zea Mays,Artificial intelligence; Climate models; Crops; Decision support systems; Economic analysis; Grain (agricultural product); Irrigation; Productivity; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Water management; Agrotechnology transfer; Crop growth model; Crop simulation model; Future climate scenarios; Increased productivity; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Relative productivity; Social and environmental; Climate change; climate change; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; economic growth; growth modeling; hybrid; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; irrigation system; maize; sugar cane; water availability; water management; Brazil; Piracicaba; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Saccharum; Zea mays,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042130831

We demonstrate that a method based on the green auto-fluorescence produced by glutaraldehyde and the tissue-clearing properties of benzyl-alcohol/benzyl-benzoate preserves the structure of the nematode-feeding sites and the plant-nematode interface with unprecedented resolution quality. This allowed us to obtain detailed measurements of the giant cells’ area in an Arabidopsis line overexpressing CHITINASE-LIKE-1 (CTL1) from optical sections by confocal microscopy, assigning a role for CTL1 and adding essential data to the scarce information of the role of gene repression in giant cells. Furthermore, subcellular structures and features of the nematodes body and tissues from thick organs formed after different biotic interactions, i.e., galls, syncytia, and nodules, were clearly distinguished without embedding or sectioning in different plant species (Arabidopsis, cucumber or Medicago). The combination of this method with molecular studies will be valuable for a better understanding of the plant-biotic interactions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Babb; Clearing; Confocal Microscopy; Ctl1; Giant Cells; Meloidogyne Spp; Nodules; Syncytia; Benzyl Alcohol; Benzyl Benzoate; Chitinase; Glutaraldehyde; Glycosidase; Arabidopsis Proteins; Ctl1 Protein, Arabidopsis; Glycoside Hydrolases; Benzyl Alcohol; Benzyl Benzoate; Chitinase; Chitinase Like 1; Glutaraldehyde; Unclassified Drug; Arabidopsis Protein; Ctl1 Protein, Arabidopsis; Glycosidase; Adult; Arabidopsis; Article; Autofluorescence; Barrel Medic; Cell Structure; Confocal Microscopy; Controlled Study; Cucumber; Feeding; Female; Gall (plant); Gene Expression; Gene Overexpression; Giant Cell; Image Processing; Meloidogyne; Meloidogyne Javanica; Nodulation; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Plant Microorganism Interaction; Syncytium; Animal; Genetics; Host Parasite Interaction; Medicago; Metabolism; Parasitology; Physiology; Plant Disease; Plant Root; Plant Tumor; Transgenic Plant; Tylenchoidea; Animals; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cucumis Sativus; Giant Cells; Glycoside Hydrolases; Host-parasite Interactions; Microscopy, Confocal; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Plant Roots; Plant Tumors; Plants, Genetically Modified","benzyl alcohol; benzyl benzoate; chitinase; chitinase like 1; glutaraldehyde; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis protein; CTL1 protein, Arabidopsis; glycosidase; adult; Arabidopsis; Article; autofluorescence; barrel medic; cell structure; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cucumber; feeding; female; gall (plant); gene expression; gene overexpression; giant cell; image processing; Meloidogyne; Meloidogyne javanica; nodulation; nonhuman; phenotype; plant microorganism interaction; syncytium; animal; genetics; host parasite interaction; Medicago; metabolism; parasitology; physiology; plant disease; plant root; plant tumor; transgenic plant; Tylenchoidea; Animals; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cucumis sativus; Giant Cells; Glycoside Hydrolases; Host-Parasite Interactions; Microscopy, Confocal; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Plant Roots; Plant Tumors; Plants, Genetically Modified",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041479792

For successful integrated management of CLS, rapid and accurate identification of the disease is essential. Diagnosis on the basis of typical visual symptoms is often compromised by the inability to differentiate CLS symptoms from similar symptoms caused by other foliar pathogens of varying significance, or from abiotic stress. An automated detection and classification of CLS and other leaf diseases, enabling a reliable basis for decisions in disease control, would be an alternative to visual as well as molecular and serological methods. This paper presents an algorithm based on a RGB-image database captured with smartphone cameras for the identification of sugar beet leaf diseases. This tool combines image acquisition and segmentation on the smartphone and advanced image data processing on a server, based on texture features using colour, intensity and gradient values. The diseases are classified using a support vector machine with radial basis function kernel. The algorithm is suitable for binary-class and multi-class classification approaches, i.e. the separation between diseased and non-diseased, and the differentiation among leaf diseases and non-infected tissue. The classification accuracy for the differentiation of CLS, ramularia leaf spot, phoma leaf spot, beet rust and bacterial blight was 82%, better than that of sugar beet experts classifying diseases from images. However, the technology has not been tested by practitioners. This tool can be adapted to other crops and their diseases and may contribute to improved decision-making in integrated disease control. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Classification Algorithm; Disease Identification; Erosion Band Signature; Rgb Images; Sugar Beet; Abiotic Factor; Accuracy Assessment; Algorithm; Crop Yield; Detection Method; Disease Control; Fungal Disease; Identification Method; Image Analysis; Integrated Approach; Mobile Phone; Molecular Analysis; Sugar Beet; Symptom; Bacteria (microorganisms); Beta Vulgaris Subsp.

Fitness costs are associated with plant NLR genes and regulation of NLR genes by micro(mi)RNAs and phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNA) is proposed as a mechanism for reducing these fitness costs. However, whether NLR expression and NLR-mediated immunity are regulated during plant growth is unclear. We conducted genome-wide transcriptome analysis and showed that NLR expression gradually increased while expression of their regulatory small RNAs (sRNA) gradually decreased as plants matured, indicating that sRNAs could play a role in regulating NLR expression during plant growth. We further tested the role of miRNA in the growth regulation of NLRs using the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) resistance gene N, which was targeted by miR6019 and miR6020. We showed that N-mediated resistance to TMV effectively restricted this virus to the infected leaves of 6-week old plants, whereas TMV infection was lethal in 1- and 3-week old seedlings due to virus-induced systemic necrosis. We further found that N transcript levels gradually increased while miR6019 levels gradually decreased during seedling maturation that occurs in the weeks after germination. Analyses of reporter genes in transgenic plants showed that growth regulation of N expression was post-transcriptionally mediated by MIR6019/6020 whereas MIR6019/6020 was regulated at the transcriptional level during plant growth. TMV infection of MIR6019/6020 transgenic plants indicated a key role for miR6019-triggered phasiRNA production for regulation of N-mediated immunity. Together our results demonstrate a mechanistic role for miRNAs in regulating innate immunity during plant growth. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nlr Proteins; Plant Proteins; Rna, Plant; Rna, Small Interfering; Microrna; Nucleotide Binding Oligomerization Domain Like Receptor; Small Interfering Rna; Plant Protein; Plant Rna; Article; Controlled Study; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Gene Control; Gene Expression; Growth Regulation; High Throughput Sequencing; Histochemistry; Image Analysis; Immunoregulation; Innate Immunity; Nicotiana Benthamiana; Nonhuman; Northern Blotting; Plant Growth; Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna Isolation; Rna Sequence; Survival Rate; Tobacco Mosaic Virus; Tomato; Transcriptomics; Comparative Study; Disease Resistance; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Immunology; Metabolism; Physiology; Plant Disease; Plant Genome; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaf; Reporter Gene; Rna Interference; Seedling; Species Difference; Tobacco; Transgenic Plant; Virology; Disease Resistance; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Reporter; Genome, Plant; Immunity, Innate; Lycopersicon Esculentum; Nlr Proteins; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Rna Interference; Rna, Plant; Rna, Small Interfering; Seedlings; Species Specificity; Tobacco; Tobacco Mosaic Virus","microRNA; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; small interfering RNA; plant protein; plant RNA; Article; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum; gene control; gene expression; growth regulation; high throughput sequencing; histochemistry; image analysis; immunoregulation; innate immunity; Nicotiana benthamiana; nonhuman; Northern blotting; plant growth; posttranscriptional gene silencing; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; RNA sequence; survival rate; Tobacco mosaic virus; tomato; transcriptomics; comparative study; disease resistance; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; immunology; metabolism; physiology; plant disease; plant genome; plant immunity; plant leaf; reporter gene; RNA interference; seedling; species difference; tobacco; transgenic plant; virology; Disease Resistance; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Reporter; Genome, Plant; Immunity, Innate; Lycopersicon esculentum; NLR Proteins; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA Interference; RNA, Plant; RNA, Small Interfering; Seedlings; Species Specificity; Tobacco; Tobacco Mosaic Virus",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041521694

However, our understanding of how ECM dictates plant immunity is largely unknown. Vascular wilt caused by the soil borne filamentous fungus Fusarium oxysporum is a major impediment for global crop productivity. To elucidate the role of ECM proteins and molecular mechanism associated with cell wall mediated immunity, the temporal changes of ECM proteome was studied in vascular wilt resistant chickpea cultivar upon F. oxysporum infection. The 2DE protein profiling coupled with mass spectrometric analysis identified 166 immune responsive proteins (IRPs) involved in variety of functions. Our data suggest that wall remodeling; protein translocation, stabilization, and chitin triggered immunity; and extracellular ATP signaling are major players in early, middle, and later phases of ECM signaling during fungal attack. Furthermore, we interrogated the proteome data using network analysis that identified modules enriched in known and novel immunity-related prognostic proteins centered around nascent aminopolypeptide complex (NAC), amine oxidase, thioredoxin, and chaperonin. This study for the first time provides an insight into the complex network operating in the ECM and impinges on the surveillance mechanism of innate immunity during patho-stress in crop plant. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chickpea; Comparative Proteomics And Protein Network; Extracellular Matrix; Fusarium Oxysporum, Innate Immunity; Vascular Wilt; Adenosine Triphosphatase; Adenosine Triphosphate; Alpha Mannosidase; Amine Oxidase (flavin Containing); Beta Glucosidase; Chalcone Synthase; Chitinase; Enolase; Ferritin; Fructose Bisphosphate Aldolase; Glucan; Mutase; Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase; Oxidoreductase; Peroxiredoxin; Phenylalanine; Reticuline; Thioredoxin; Uridine Diphosphate; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Adenosine Triphosphatase; Adenosine Triphosphate; Alpha Mannosidase; Amine Oxidase (flavin Containing); Beta Glucosidase; Chalcone Synthase; Chaperonin; Chitinase; Enolase; Ferritin; Flavoprotein; Fructose Bisphosphate Aldolase; Glucan; Mutase; Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase; Oxidoreductase; Peroxiredoxin; Phenylalanine; Proteome; Reticuline; Scleroprotein; Thioredoxin; Uridine Diphosphate; Plant Protein; Article; Cell Wall; Chickpea; Controlled Study; Extracellular Matrix; Fungal Plant Disease; Fusarium Oxysporum; Image Analysis; Immune Response; Innate Immunity; Late Blight; Nonhuman; Nuclear Reprogramming; Plant Immunity; Priority Journal; Protein Analysis; Protein Expression; Protein Interaction; Proteomics; Quantitative Analysis; Seedling; Cicer; Cytology; Fusarium; Host Pathogen Interaction; Immunology; Metabolism; Microbiology; Physiology; Plant Disease; Procedures; Cell Wall; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Host-pathogen Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics","adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; alpha mannosidase; amine oxidase (flavin containing); beta glucosidase; chalcone synthase; chaperonin; chitinase; enolase; ferritin; flavoprotein; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; glucan; mutase; nucleoside diphosphate kinase; oxidoreductase; peroxiredoxin; phenylalanine; proteome; reticuline; scleroprotein; thioredoxin; uridine diphosphate; plant protein; Article; cell wall; chickpea; controlled study; extracellular matrix; fungal plant disease; Fusarium oxysporum; image analysis; immune response; innate immunity; late blight; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; plant immunity; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein interaction; proteomics; quantitative analysis; seedling; Cicer; cytology; Fusarium; host pathogen interaction; immunology; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; plant disease; procedures; Cell Wall; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038424914

To screen peanut for aflatoxin resistance, ten genotypes were infected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)—expressing Aspergillus flavus strain. Percentages of fungal infected area and fungal GFP signal intensity were documented by visual ratings every 8 h for 72 h after inoculation. Significant genotypic differences in fungal growth rates were documented by repeated measures and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) analyses. SICIA (Seed Infection Coverage and Intensity Analyzer), an image processing software, was developed to digitize fungal GFP signals. Data from SICIA image analysis confirmed visual rating results validating its utility for quantifying fungal growth. Among the tested peanut genotypes, NC 3033 and GT-C20 supported the lowest and highest fungal growth on the surface of peanut seeds, respectively. Although differential fungal growth was observed on the surface of peanut seeds, total fungal growth in the seeds was not significantly different across genotypes based on a fluorometric GFP assay. Significant differences in aflatoxin B levels were detected across peanut genotypes. ICG 1471 had the lowest aflatoxin level whereas Florida-07 had the highest. Two-year aflatoxin tests under simulated late-season drought also showed that ICG 1471 had reduced aflatoxin production under pre-harvest field conditions.

Modern plant breeding technologies have focussed on molecular markers, but for many crop species, this technology is unavailable. Therefore, prematurity predictors of harvestable yield would accelerate the release of new varieties. Metabolic biomarkers are routinely used in medicine, but they have been largely overlooked as predictive tools in plant science. We aimed to identify biomarkers of productivity in the bioenergy crop, Miscanthus, that could be used prognostically to predict future yields. This study identified a metabolic profile reflecting productivity in Miscanthus by correlating the summer carbohydrate composition of multiple genotypes with final yield 6 months later. Consistent and strong, significant correlations were observed between carbohydrate metrics and biomass traits at two separate field sites over 2 years. Machine-learning feature selection was used to optimize carbohydrate metrics for support vector regression models, which were able to predict interyear biomass traits with a correlation (R) of >0.67 between predicted and actual values. To identify a causal basis for the relationships between the glycome profile and biomass, a 13C-labelling experiment compared carbohydrate partitioning between high- and low-yielding genotypes. A lower yielding and slower growing genotype partitioned a greater percentage of the 13C pulse into starch compared to a faster growing genotype where a greater percentage was located in the structural biomass. These results supported a link between plant performance and carbon flow through two rival pathways (starch vs. sucrose), with higher yielding plants exhibiting greater partitioning into structural biomass, via sucrose metabolism, rather than starch. Our results demonstrate that the plant metabolome can be used prognostically to anticipate future yields and this is a method that could be used to accelerate selection in perennial energy crop breeding programmes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",13c; Bioenergy; Biomarkers; Carbohydrates; Cell Wall; Miscanthus; Soluble Sugars; Starch; Agriculture; Biofuels; Biomarkers; Carbohydrates; Carbon; Crops; Forecasting; Learning Systems; Metabolism; Productivity; Regression Analysis; Starch; Sugar (sucrose); Bio-energy; Cell Walls; Miscanthus; Soluble Sugars; ^13c; Biomass; Bioenergy; Biomarker; Biomass; Carbohydrate; Carbon Isotope; Crop Yield; Grass; Prediction; Starch; Sugar,Agriculture; Biofuels; Biomarkers; Carbohydrates; Carbon; Crops; Forecasting; Learning systems; Metabolism; Productivity; Regression analysis; Starch; Sugar (sucrose); Bio-energy; Cell walls; Miscanthus; Soluble sugars; ^13C; Biomass; bioenergy; biomarker; biomass; carbohydrate; carbon isotope; crop yield; grass; prediction; starch; sugar,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010641867

Plant disease can be caused either by living organisms having wide range as harmful or benign ones which grow specifically on the horticultural plant leaves or deficiency of minerals e.g. iron, phosphate, nitrogen, etc. Modern agriculture requires smart and feasible techniques to replace the human intelligence with machine intelligence. Whereas a human identifies the disease infected leaves by his eye, the machine should also be capable of vision-based disease identification. The objective of this paper is to practically verify the applicability of a new computer-vision method for discrimination between the healthy and disease infected strawberry leaves which does not require neural network or time consuming trainings. The proposed method was tested under outdoor lighting condition using a regular DLSR camera without any particular lens. Since the type and infection degree of disease is approximated a human brain a fuzzy decision maker classifies the leaves over the images captured on-site having the same properties of human vision. Optimizing the fuzzy parameters for a typical horticultural field at a mid-day summer Mediterranean day in produced 96% accuracy for segmented iron deficiency and 93% accuracy for segmented using a typical human instant classification approximation as the benchmark holding higher accuracy than a human eye identifier.

Growing sugarbeets for biofuel production may have significant impacts on soil health and water quality in the north-central regions of the U.S., where 50% of the nation's total sugarbeets were produced in 2015. Almost all the current sugarbeet models simulate only plant growth and yield but have no capability to simulate the effects of sugarbeet production on soil and water quality. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) is a widely used model that simulates crop yield, water flow, and transport of salts and nitrogen in crop fields. RZWQM is currently linked to 23 specific crop models in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) version 4.0, not including a sugarbeet model. In this study, the Crop and Environment REsource Synthesis (CERES) in RZWQM was adapted for sugarbeet simulation to model the soil and water quality impact of sugarbeet for biofuel production. The Beet model was then evaluated against dryland sugarbeet production at the Carrington Research and Extension Station (North Dakota) in 2014 and 2015. The PEST (Parameter ESTimation) tool in RZWQM was used for parameter estimation and sensitivity and identifiability analysis. The model did reasonably well in both 2014 (d-statistic = 0.709 to 0.992; rRMSE = 0.066 to 1.211) and 2015 (d-statistic = 0.733 to 0.990; rRMSE = 0.043 to 0.930) in terms of simulating leaf area index, top weight, root weight, soil water content, and soil nitrates. Under dry conditions, the most sensitive soil parameters were soil bulk densities and saturated hydraulic conductivities in different layers. Identifiability analysis also showed that three to five model parameters may be identifiable by calibration datasets. RZWQM enhanced with a sugarbeet module and its parameter analysis can be used for water use optimization under dryland conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biofuels; Ceres; Dssat; Rzwqm; Sugarbeet; Artificial Intelligence; Biofuels; Crops; Decision Support Systems; Flow Of Water; Hydraulic Conductivity; Parameter Estimation; Soil Moisture; Sugar Beets; Water Quality; Agrotechnology Transfer; Ceres; Dssat; Identifiability Analysis; Parameter Sensitivities; Root Zone Water Quality Models; Rzwqm; Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity; Quality Control; Agricultural Modeling; Agricultural Production; Agricultural Technology; Biofuel; Crop Yield; Data Set; Decision Support System; Dryland Farming; Ecosystem Health; Energy Crop; Leaf Area Index; Parameter Estimation; Rhizosphere; Sensitivity Analysis; Soil Property; Soil Quality; Solute Transport; Sugar Beet; Water Content; Water Flow; Water Quality; Weight; North Dakota; United States; Beta Vulgaris Subsp.

Upon recognition of “nonself” components, plant cells deploy a variety of immune responses including cell wall fortification. Callose, a β-(1, 3)-D-glucan polymer, is a component of the material deposited at the site of infection between the plasma membrane and the preexisting cell wall that is hypothesized to serve as a physical barrier and platform for directed antimicrobial compound deposition. The defense-associated function of callose deposition is supported by its induction during pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and its inhibition by defense suppressing virulence effectors. Thus, callose deposition is a commonly monitored read-out in plant defense.

In recent years, in order to eliminate or reduce the damage caused by weeds in sugar beet farming, weed control has gained importance. To this end, various studies have been conducted on robotic weed control by detecting weeds using image processing algorithms and hoeing or spraying the weeds. In this study, weeds in sugar beet fields were detected by the image processing algorithm and were sprayed with a liquid. When height of spraying nozzle above the ground was 30 cm and 50 cm, measurements of spraying robot were carried out for 8 different speeds. The weed surface covering area of spraying liquid was evaluated by two different methods. A decrease of 40% in nozzle height of smart spraying robot caused a decrease of about 12.18% at 4 different weeds surface covering area (cm2) of spraying liquid and a decrease of 16.70% at weed surface covering area (pixels) of spraying liquid. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Herbicide Application; Image Processing; Precision Agriculture; Precision Spraying,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008210344

Plants, in turn, have developed diverse defense mechanisms to identify and evade different pathogenic microorganisms. Early identification of plant disease resistance genes (R genes) can be exploited for crop improvement programs. The present prediction methods are either based on sequence similarity/domain-based methods or electronically annotated sequences, which might miss existing unrecognized proteins or low similarity proteins. Therefore, there is an urgent need to devise a novel machine learning technique to address this problem. In the current study, a SVM-based tool was developed for prediction of disease resistance proteins in plants. All known disease resistance (R) proteins (112) were taken as a positive set, whereas manually curated negative dataset consisted of 119 R proteins. Feature extraction generated 10,270 features using 16 different methods. The ten-fold cross validation was performed to optimize SVM parameters using radial basis function. The model was derived using libSVM and achieved an overall accuracy of 91.11% on the test dataset. The tool was found to be robust and can be used for high-throughput datasets.

Phosphite is one of the only effective chemicals to control broad-scale Phytophthora disease. Little work has been done on the phytotoxic effects of phosphite application on plant communities especially in combination with plant physiological impacts. Here, we tested the phytotoxic impact of phosphite applied as foliar spray at 0, 12, 24 and 48 kg a.i. ha(-1) . Eighteen-month-old saplings of 13 conifer and angiosperm species native to New Zealand, and two exotic coniferous species were treated and the development of necrotic tissue and chlorophyll-a-fluorescence parameters (optimal quantum yield, Fv /Fm ; effective quantum yield of photosystem II, ΦPSII ) were assessed. In addition, stomatal conductance (gs ) was measured on a subset of six species. Significant necrosis assessed by digital image analysis occurred in only three species: in the lauraceous canopy tree Beilschmiedia tawa (8-14%) and the understory shrub Dodonaea viscosa (5-7%) across phosphite concentrations and solely at the highest concentration in the myrtaceous pioneer shrub Leptospermum scoparium (66%). In non-necrotic tissue, Fv /Fm , ΦPSII and gs remained unaffected by the phosphite treatment. Overall, our findings suggest minor phytotoxic effects resulting from foliar phosphite application across diverse taxa and regardless of concentration. This study supports the large-scale use of phosphite as a management tool to control plant diseases caused by Phytophthora pathogens in plantations and natural ecosystems.

Considering the characteristics of the mechanisms and data related to yield, data mining techniques are suitable candidates for modelling. The use of these techniques within a context with feature engineering, feature selection, and proper tuning can further improve performance beyond a simple replacement of multiple linear regression. To evaluate the impact of the different steps in the mentioned context, we evaluated sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) yield modelling with data obtained from a sugarcane mill. For a combination of six techniques, tuning, feature selection, and feature engineering, leading to 66 combinations, we assessed final model performance. Average performance across combinations resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.42 Mg ha−1. Using different techniques led to a range of MAE from 4.57 to 8.80 Mg ha−1 on average. The best and worst performances for an individual model were MAEs of 4.11 and 9.00 Mg ha−1. Models with lower performance were close to simply predicting yield from the average yield for each number of cuts (MAE of 9.86 Mg ha−1). Tuning and feature engineering reduced the MAE on average by 1.17 and 0.64 Mg ha−1, respectively. Feature selection removed nearly 40% of the features but increased the MAE by 0.19 Mg ha−1. The performance of models was improved by simple strategies such as decomposing weather attributes and detailing fertilisation. Evaluation of feature importance provided by the RReliefF feature selection algorithm was used to explain the performance gains.

In plants, this involves plasma membrane-resident pattern recognition receptors, one of which is the FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) receptor kinase. Ligand-activated FLS2 receptors are internalized into endosomes. However, the extent to which these spatiotemporal dynamics are generally present among pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and their regulation remain elusive. Using live-cell imaging, we show that at least three other receptor kinases associated with plant immunity, PEP RECEPTOR 1/2 (PEPR1/2) and EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR), internalize in a ligand-specific manner. In all cases, endocytosis requires the coreceptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), and thus depends on receptor activation status. We also show the internalization of liganded FLS2, suggesting the transport of signaling competent receptors. Trafficking of activated PRRs requires clathrin and converges onto the same endosomal vesicles that are also shared with the hormone receptor BRASSINOSTERIOD INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1). Importantly, clathrin-dependent endocytosis participates in plant defense against bacterial infection involving FLS2-mediated stomatal closure and callose deposition, but is uncoupled from activation of the flagellin-induced oxidative burst and MAP kinase signaling. In conclusion, immunity mediated by pattern recognition receptors depends on clathrin, a critical component for the endocytosis of signaling competent receptors into a common endosomal pathway. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clathrin; Efr; Fls2; Pattern-triggered Immunity; Pepr1; Abscisic Acid; Flagellin; Arabidopsis Proteins; Clathrin; Flagellin; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Ligands; Plant Proteins; Receptors, Pattern Recognition; Abscisic Acid; Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 Protein; Bri1 Associated Kinase 1; Clathrin; Clathrin Heavy Chain; Elongation Factor Tu; Flagellin; Ligand; Pattern Recognition Receptor; Pep Receptor 1; Pep Receptor 2; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Unclassified Drug; Arabidopsis Protein; Green Fluorescent Protein; Plant Protein; Arabidopsis; Article; Bacterial Infection; Binding Affinity; Cell Membrane; Cellular Distribution; Comparative Study; Controlled Study; Cotyledon; Down Regulation; Drought Stress; Endocytosis; Endosome; Gene Silencing; Heterologous Expression; Image Analysis; Immune Response; Immunity; Ligand Binding; Nicotiana Benthamiana; Plant Defense; Plant Growth; Plant Immunity; Plant Leaf; Priority Journal; Protein Localization; Quantitative Analysis; Respiratory Burst; Transient Expression; Autophagy; Immunology; Metabolism; Microbiology; Physiology; Plant Disease; Plant Stoma; Signal Transduction; Tobacco; Arabidopsis Proteins; Autophagy; Clathrin; Endocytosis; Endosomes; Flagellin; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Ligands; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Plant Stomata; Receptors, Pattern Recognition; Signal Transduction; Tobacco","abscisic acid; brassinosteroid insensitive 1 protein; bri1 associated kinase 1; clathrin; clathrin heavy chain; elongation factor Tu; flagellin; ligand; pattern recognition receptor; pep receptor 1; pep receptor 2; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis protein; green fluorescent protein; plant protein; Arabidopsis; Article; bacterial infection; binding affinity; cell membrane; cellular distribution; comparative study; controlled study; cotyledon; down regulation; drought stress; endocytosis; endosome; gene silencing; heterologous expression; image analysis; immune response; immunity; ligand binding; Nicotiana benthamiana; plant defense; plant growth; plant immunity; plant leaf; priority journal; protein localization; quantitative analysis; respiratory burst; transient expression; autophagy; immunology; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; plant disease; plant stoma; signal transduction; tobacco; Arabidopsis Proteins; Autophagy; Clathrin; Endocytosis; Endosomes; Flagellin; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Ligands; Plant Diseases; Plant Immunity; Plant Proteins; Plant Stomata; Receptors, Pattern Recognition; Signal Transduction; Tobacco",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989876383

Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the tolerant cereals that its grain components have an important role in human and animal nutrition; however, physical and biochemical properties of grains affected through drought stress are still poorly understood. In this study, barley genotypes (n= 6) with different levels of drought tolerance were studied in a 2-year field experiment under well-watered and terminal drought stress conditions. In order to measure physical properties of grains, digital images were taken and some morphological features were obtained by using Image Analysis Toolbox of MATLAB software. Biochemical properties of grains were also measured. Results proved that size, weight and also quality of the grains were significantly affected by drought stress (P< 0.01). Grain starch content decreased and protein content increased under drought stress at anthesis stage in all genotypes, but drought-sensitive genotypes interestingly had more percentage increase in protein content. Furthermore, genotypes varied in total sugar, sucrose, glucose and fructose content. Drought stress affected grain size and finally 1,000-grain weight of barley genotypes by reducing area and minor axis length of grains. Correlations between 1,000-grain weight and minor axis length, grain area, starch and sucrose content were significant (P< 0.01). These results emphasized in both conditions that size-dependent features of grain particularly minor axis length and area may be serving as useful traits for estimation of 1,000-grain weight and biochemical properties in barley. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Grain Size; Hordeum Vulgare L; Image Analysis; Protein; Starch,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988664250

The sugarcane cultivation and sugar industry plays a vital role towards socio-economic development in the rural areas by creating higher income and employment opportunities. Early detection and management of problems associated with sugarcane yield indicators enables the decision makers and planners to decide import or export policies. In this work, a hybrid approach using fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) learning algorithms for sugarcane yield classification is proposed, combining the key aspects of Data Driven Nonlinear Hebbian Learning (DDNHL) algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (GA) called FCM-DDNHL-GA. The FCM model developed for the proposed study includes various soil and climate parameters which influence the precision agriculture application of sugarcane yield prediction. The classification accuracies and inference capabilities of the hybrid learning algorithm of FCMs are analyzed and compared with some well-known machine learning algorithms for sugarcane yield monitoring application.

We reconstructed the global F. graminearum gene regulatory network (GRN) from a large collection of transcriptomic data using Bayesian network inference, a machine-learning algorithm. This GRN reveals connectivity between key regulators and their target genes. Focusing on key regulators, this network contains eight distinct but interwoven modules. Enriched for unique functions, such as cell cycle, DNA replication, transcription, translation and stress responses, each module exhibits distinct expression profiles. Evolutionarily, the F. graminearum genome can be divided into core regions shared with closely related species and variable regions harboring genes that are unique to F. graminearum and perform species-specific functions. Interestingly, the inferred top regulators regulate genes that are significantly enriched from the same genomic regions (P < 0.05), revealing a compartmentalized network structure that may reflect network rewiring related to specific adaptation of this plant pathogen. This first-ever reconstructed filamentous fungal GRN primes our understanding of pathogenicity at the systems biology level and provides enticing prospects for novel disease control strategies involving the targeting of master regulators in pathogens.

In this paper, we present preliminary work in developing a UAV-mounted sensor suite for detection of citrus greening disease, a major threat to Florida citrus production. We propose a depth-invariant sensing methodology for measuring reflectance of polarized amber light, a metric which has been found to measure starch accumulation in greening-infected leaves. We describe the implications of adding depth information to this method, including the use of machine learning models to discriminate between healthy and infected leaves with validation accuracies up to 93%. Additionally, we discuss stipulations and challenges of use of the system with UAV platforms. This sensing system has the potential to allow for rapid scanning of groves to determine the spread of the disease, especially in areas where infection is still in early stages, including citrus farms in California. Although presented in the context of citrus greening disease, the methods can be applied to a variety of plant pathology studies, enabling timely monitoring of plant health-impacting scientists, growers, and policymakers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Crashworthiness; Learning Systems; Plants (botany); Remote Sensing; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Citrus Greening Disease; Citrus Production; Depth Information; Machine Learning Models; Mounted Sensors; Plant Pathology; Sensing Systems; Starch Accumulation; Robotics,Artificial intelligence; Crashworthiness; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Citrus greening disease; Citrus production; Depth information; Machine learning models; Mounted sensors; Plant pathology; Sensing systems; Starch accumulation; Robotics,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977488477

Xcv pathogenicity depends on a type III secretion (T3S) system that delivers effector proteins into host cells to suppress plant immunity and promote disease. The pool of known Xcv effectors includes approximately 30 proteins, most identified in the 85-10 strain by various experimental and computational techniques. To identify additional Xcv 85-10 effectors, we applied a genome-wide machine-learning approach, in which all open reading frames (ORFs) were scored according to their propensity to encode effectors. Scoring was based on a large set of features, including genomic organization, taxonomic dispersion, hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp)-dependent expression, 5′ regulatory sequences, amino acid composition bias and GC content. Thirty-six predicted effectors were tested for translocation into plant cells using the hypersensitive response (HR)-inducing domain of AvrBs2 as a reporter. Seven proteins (XopAU, XopAV, XopAW, XopAP, XopAX, XopAK and XopAD) harboured a functional translocation signal and their translocation relied on the HrpF translocon, indicating that they are bona fideT3S effectors. Remarkably, four belong to novel effector families. Inactivation of the xopAP gene reduced the severity of disease symptoms in infected plants. A decrease in cell death and chlorophyll content was observed in pepper leaves inoculated with the xopAP mutant when compared with the wild-type strain. However, populations of the xopAP mutant in infected leaves were similar in size to those of wild-type bacteria, suggesting that the reduction in virulence was not caused by impaired bacterial growth. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Effector; Machine Learning; Pathogenomics; Pepper; Type Iii Secretion System; Xanthomonas Euvesicatoria; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Secretion Systems; Bacterial Protein; Bacterial Secretion System; Dna Base Composition; Genetics; Machine Learning; Metabolism; Microbiology; Mutation; Pepper; Phylogeny; Plant Cell; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Protein Transport; Tobacco; Xanthomonas; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Secretion Systems; Base Composition; Capsicum; Machine Learning; Mutation; Phylogeny; Plant Cells; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Protein Transport; Tobacco,bacterial protein; bacterial secretion system; DNA base composition; genetics; machine learning; metabolism; microbiology; mutation; pepper; phylogeny; plant cell; plant disease; plant leaf; protein transport; tobacco; Xanthomonas; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Secretion Systems; Base Composition; Capsicum; Machine Learning; Mutation; Phylogeny; Plant Cells; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Protein Transport; Tobacco,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961212908

We used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici to study the genetic architecture of thermal adaptation and identify candidate genes. Four wild-type strains originating from the same thermal environment were crossed to generate two mapping populations with 263 (cross 1) and 261 (cross 2) progeny. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing was used to genotype 9745 (cross 1) and 7333 (cross 2) single-nucleotide polymorphism markers segregating within the mapping population. Temperature sensitivity was assessed using digital image analysis of colonies growing at two different temperatures. We identified four QTLs for temperature sensitivity, with unique QTLs found in each cross. One QTL had a logarithm of odds score >11 and contained only six candidate genes, including PBS2, encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase associated with low temperature tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This and other QTLs showed evidence for pleiotropy among growth rate, melanization and growth morphology, suggesting that many traits can be correlated with thermal adaptation in fungi. Higher temperatures were highly correlated with a shift to filamentous growth among the progeny in both crosses. We show that thermal adaptation has a complex genetic architecture, with natural populations of Z. tritici harboring significant genetic variation for this trait. We conclude that Z. tritici populations have the potential to adapt rapidly to climate change and expand into new climatic zones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dna, Fungal; Climate Change; Fungus; Genetic Structure; Genetic Variation; Growth Rate; Image Analysis; Morphology; Pathogen; Pleiotropy; Protein; Selection; Sensitivity Analysis; Temperature Effect; Temperature Tolerance; Fungi; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Triticum Aestivum; Fungal Dna; Acclimatization; Ascomycetes; Chromosomal Mapping; Cross Breeding; Dna Sequence; Genetics; Genotype; Microbiology; Phenotype; Physiology; Plant Disease; Quantitative Trait Locus; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Temperature; Wheat; Acclimatization; Ascomycota; Chromosome Mapping; Crosses, Genetic; Dna, Fungal; Genetic Pleiotropy; Genotype; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Sequence Analysis, Dna; Temperature; Triticum","climate change; fungus; genetic structure; genetic variation; growth rate; image analysis; morphology; pathogen; pleiotropy; protein; selection; sensitivity analysis; temperature effect; temperature tolerance; Fungi; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Triticum aestivum; fungal DNA; acclimatization; Ascomycetes; chromosomal mapping; cross breeding; DNA sequence; genetics; genotype; microbiology; phenotype; physiology; plant disease; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; temperature; wheat; Acclimatization; Ascomycota; Chromosome Mapping; Crosses, Genetic; DNA, Fungal; Genetic Pleiotropy; Genotype; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Temperature; Triticum",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960363280

The surface biomass reflects the crop vigor at the seeding stage. In order to monitor the winter wheat growth efficiently, accurately and at low cost, this study researched the image features of the winter wheat canopy and the best monitor model. The Daheng IMAVISION's DH-HV3151UC-M industrial camera with 3 million pixels was used to capture the winter wheat canopy images of the 20 different cultivars during the seeding stage. Then the ground fresh weight of the winter wheat was detected by using weighing method. The characteristic parameters of the image were extracted to build the wheat coverage by image processing, and the relationship between the wheat coverage and the winter wheat biomass was studied. The results showed that the winter wheat biomass was different in the different period as the vegetation, and the wheat coverage changed in accord with the winter wheat biomass of different cultivars at the different planting densities. Regression Analysis was used to establish the correlative model of wheat coverage vs. the winter wheat biomass by using 80 sets of data, and it can be found that the exponential function was the best model (R2=0.834,RMSE=0.012). The rest 39 sets of data were taken to validate the model (R2=0.777, RMSE=0.016). The result of this study indicated that it was significant for monitoring the winter wheat biomass using the canopy image at seeding. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Canopy Image; Fresh Biomass; Monitoring; Seeding; Winter Wheat; Biomass; Cloud Seeding; Ecology; Exponential Functions; Image Processing; Monitoring; Regression Analysis; Canopy Image; Correlative Models; Growth And Development; Image Features; Nutritional Qualities; Planting Density; Weighing Method; Winter Wheat; Crops,Biomass; Cloud seeding; Ecology; Exponential functions; Image processing; Monitoring; Regression analysis; Canopy image; Correlative models; Growth and development; Image features; Nutritional qualities; Planting density; Weighing method; Winter wheat; Crops,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012050260

RZWQM is linked to 23 specific crop models in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), not including a sugarbeet model. In this research, Crop and Environment REsource Synthesis (CERES) Beet model was incorporated into DSSAT, which was in turn linked with RZWQM to model the soil and water quality impact of growing sugarbeet for biofuel production.

The previous study used fixed cells, in which AFs were stained with fluorescently labeled phalloidine, therefore the structural dynamics of haustorium-surrounding AFs has not been examined. In the present study, we performed a live imaging analysis to examine the dynamics and developmental changes in the organization of haustorium-surrounding host AFs using host Arabidopsis thaliana and A. thaliana-adapted powdery mildew fungus Golovinomyces orontii. Image correlation-based velocimetry analysis suggested that AFs around haustorium are rather static compared to the dynamicity of AFs at the cell surface. Quantification of AF density and bundling showed that the density, but not the level of bundling, of haustorium-surrounding AFs increased as the haustorium matures.

High P input levels in agriculture have led to environmental problems. One of the ways to tackle these issues simultaneously is improving phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) of the crops through breeding. In this review, we describe plant architectural and physiological traits important for PUE. Subsequently, we discuss efficient methods of screening for PUE traits. We address targeted cultivation methods, including solid and hydroponic systems, as well as testing methods, such as image analysis systems, and biomass and photosynthesis measurements. Genetic variation for PUE traits has been assessed in many crops, and genetics of PUE has been studied by quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses and genome-wide association study. A number of genes involved in the plant’s response to low P have been characterized. These genes include transcription factors, and genes involved in signal transduction, hormonal pathways, sugar signalling, P saving metabolic pathways, and in P scavenging, including transporters and metabolites and/or ATP-ases mobilizing P in the soil. In addition, the role of microorganisms promoting PUE of plants, particularly arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is discussed. An overview is given of methods for selecting for optimal combinations of plant and fungal genotypes, and their genetics, incl. QTLs and genes involved. In conclusion, significant progress has been made in selecting for traits for PUE, developing systems for the difficult but highly relevant root phenotyping, and in identifying QTLs and genes involved. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Breeding; Mycorrhiza; Nutrient Use Efficiency; Phosphorus; Plant Phenotyping; Root Architecture,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951567481

It controls several plant root diseases caused by Fusarium fungi through the mechanism of competition for nutrients and niches (CNN). This mechanism does not rely on the production of antibiotics, so it avoids the concerns of resistance development and is environmentally safe. Additionally, this bacterium promotes plant growth by alleviating salt stress for its plant host. To investigate the genetic mechanisms that may explain these observations, we determined the complete genome sequence of this bacterium, examined its gene content, and performed comparative genomics analysis with other Pseudomonas strains. The genome of P. fluorescens PCL1751 consisted of one circular chromosome that is 6,143,950 basepairs (bp) in size; no plasmid was found. The annotation included 19 rRNA, 70 tRNA, and 5,534 protein-coding genes. The gene content analysis identified a large number of genes involved in chemotaxis and motility, colonization of the rhizosphere, siderophore biosynthesis, and osmoprotectant production. In contrast, the pathways involved in the biosynthesis of phytohormones or antibiotics were not found. Comparison with other Pseudomonas genomes revealed extensive variations in their genome size and gene content. The presence and absence of secretion system genes were highly variable. As expected, the synteny conservation among strains decreased as a function of phylogenetic divergence. The integration of prophages appeared to be an important driver for genome rearrangements. The whole-genome gene content analysis of this plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) provided some genetic explanations to its phenotypic characteristics. The extensive and versatile substrate utilization pathways, together with the presence of many genes involved in competitive root colonization, provided further support for the finding that this strain achieves biological control of pathogens through effective competition for nutrients and niches.

Our analyses revealed 32 differentially expressed peptides associated with RPW infestation in date palm stem. To identify RPW infestation associated peptides (I), artificially wounded plants (W) were used as additional control beside uninfested plants, a conventional control (C). A constant unique pattern of differential expression in infested (I), wounded (W) stem samples compared to control (C) was observed. The upregulated proteins showed relative fold intensity in order of I > W and downregulated spots trend as W > I, a quite interesting pattern. This study also reveals that artificially wounding of date palm stem affects almost the same proteins as infestation; however, relative intensity is quite lower than in infested samples both in up and downregulated spots. All 32 differentially expressed spots were subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis for their identification and we were able to match 21 proteins in the already existing databases.

Due to the variety and complexity of the open field, it is a great challenge to achieve continuous and robust foliar disease observation in real field conditions. We propose a novel and compact algorithm, composed of two frameworks and a post-processing. The algorithm has continuous and highly discriminative capabilities for observing the process of disease in a single leaf from plant-level time sequence images. The first framework is based on robust template matching by orientation code matching (OCM), which implements successive tracking of a single leaf from a beet plant against severe illumination changes and non-rigid plant movements. The second framework uses a pattern recognition method of support vector machine (SVM) for achieving further disease classification from clutter field background. Prior to SVM, we propose a three feature combination of L*, a*, Entropy×Density, which has strong discrimination power to classify CLS disease from the clutter scene containing sandy soil, leaves, leaf stalks, and specular reflection. Additionally, post-processing is introduced to filter false positive noise to enhance the precision of the classification. Field experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed algorithm for disease monitoring under real field conditions. Meanwhile, comparative results with other conventional matching methods and feature combinations show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in both foliage tracking and disease classification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Foliar Disease Monitoring; Image Processing; Machine Learning; Pattern Recognition; Sugar Beets; Template Matching; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Clutter (information Theory); Image Processing; Learning Systems; Molasses; Optical Character Recognition; Pattern Recognition; Plants (botany); Sugar Beets; Support Vector Machines; Template Matching; Disease Classification; Disease Monitoring; Feature Combination; Foliar Disease; Illumination Changes; Orientation Code Matching; Pattern Recognition Method; Specular Reflections; Image Matching; Algorithm; Disease Incidence; Fieldwork; Foliage; Fungal Disease; Image Processing; Leaf; Machine Learning; Monitoring System; Pattern Recognition; Sugar Beet; Support Vector Machine; Beta Vulgaris Subsp.

Proteomic analysis by 2DE-PAGE-MS / MS revealed the identity of 40 proteins differentially expressed between CTV- infected and -non-infected samples. Of these, 33 were up-regulated and 7 were down-regulated in CTV-infected samples. Among the proteins identified stands out a specific from the virus, the coat protein. Other proteins identified are involved with oxidative stress and for this their enzymatic activity was measured. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was higher in CTV-infected samples, as catalase (CAT) showed higher activity in uninfected samples. The activity of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) did not vary significantly between samples. However, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) was more active in the infected samples. The relative expression of the genes encoding CAT, SOD, APX and GPX was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR (RTqPCR). The CTV-infected samples showed greater accumulation of transcripts, except for the CAT gene. This gene showed higher expression in the uninfected samples. Taken together, it can be concluded that the CTV affects the protein profile and activity and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in plants infected by this virus. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ascorbate Peroxidase; Catalase; Superoxide Dismutase; Peroxidase; Ascorbate Peroxidases; Catalase; Enzymes; Guaiacol Peroxidase; Peroxidase; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Superoxide Dismutase; Ascorbate Peroxidase; Catalase; Guaiacol Peroxidase; Superoxide Dismutase; Enzyme; Peroxidase; Plant Protein; Proteome; Antioxidant Activity; Apx Gene; Article; Biotic Stress; Cat Gene; Citrus Tristeza Virus; Controlled Study; Dna Synthesis; Down Regulation; Enzyme Activity; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gpx Gene; Image Analysis; Nonhuman; Oxidative Stress; Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis; Protein Analysis; Proteomics; Quantitative Analysis; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sod Gene; Sweet Orange; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Upregulation; Closterovirus; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Host Pathogen Interaction; Metabolism; Physiology; Plant Disease; Procedures; Two Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis; Virology; Ascorbate Peroxidases; Catalase; Citrus Sinensis; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-dimensional; Enzymes; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Host-pathogen Interactions; Peroxidase; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Superoxide Dismutase; Tandem Mass Spectrometry","ascorbate peroxidase; catalase; guaiacol peroxidase; superoxide dismutase; enzyme; peroxidase; plant protein; proteome; antioxidant activity; APX gene; Article; biotic stress; CAT gene; Citrus tristeza virus; controlled study; DNA synthesis; down regulation; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene expression profiling; GPX gene; image analysis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein analysis; proteomics; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SOD gene; sweet orange; tandem mass spectrometry; upregulation; Closterovirus; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; physiology; plant disease; procedures; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; virology; Ascorbate Peroxidases; Catalase; Citrus sinensis; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Enzymes; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Peroxidase; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Superoxide Dismutase; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941901806

In order to examine the molecular mechanisms that characterize the interaction between B. cinerea and the host plant, the grapevine cytoplasmic proteome was analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The interaction between Vitis vinifera cv. Gamay cells and B. cinerea was characterized by the increase in spot abundance of 30 proteins, of which 21 were successfully identified. The majority of these proteins were related to defence and stress responses and to cell wall modifications. Some of the modulated proteins have been previously found to be affected by other pathogens when they infect V. vinifera but interestingly, the proteins related to cell wall modification that were influenced by B. cinerea have not been shown to be modulated by any other pathogen studied to date. Transcript analysis using the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction additionally revealed the up-regulation of several acidic, probably extracellular, chitinases. The results indicate that cell wall strengthening, accumulation of PR proteins and excretion of lytic enzymes are likely to be important mechanisms in the defence of grapevine against B. cinerea. Biological significance: Although gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea is one of the most important diseases of grapevine, little information is available about proteomic changes in this pathosystem. These results suggest that cell wall strengthening, accumulation of PR proteins and excretion of lytic enzymes are important molecular mechanisms in the defence of grapevine against B. cinerea.

Fungal isolates from hop differ in aggressiveness, causing either mild or lethal symptoms in infected plants. As in other plant pathogenic fungi, extracellular proteins, such as cell wall-degrading enzymes and effectors, are thought to be crucial in the pathogenesis process. In this study, mild and lethal isolates from three countries were grown in simulated xylem medium and secretome analysis by 2D-DIGE showed low qualitative and high quantitative variability among the isolates. Functional classification of 194 identified proteins representing 100 unique protein accessions revealed an arsenal of cell wall-degrading enzymes and potential effectors. The set of proteins that were more abundant in at least two lethal isolates included enzymes acetylcholinesterases, lipases, polygalacturonases, pectate lyase, rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterases, acetylxylan esterase, endoglucanase, xylanases, mannosidases, and a protein similar to alginate lyase and also potential effectors necrosis- and ethylene-inducing protein, small basic 14 kDa hypothetical protein and 79 kDa hypothetical proteins. Other proteins associated with virulence showed different expression profiles between mild and lethal isolates. The results suggest that the increased virulence of lethal isolates has little background shared by all three lethal isolates and that upregulation of isolate specific sets of proteins may be most important. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2d-dige; Microbiology; Pathotype; Secretome; Verticillium Albo-atrum; Acetylcholinesterase; Acetylesterase; Glucan Synthase; Mannosidase; Melanin; Pectate Lyase; Triacylglycerol Lipase; Xylan Endo 1,3 Beta Xylosidase; Fungal Proteins; Acetylcholinesterase; Acetylesterase; Enzyme; Glucan Synthase; Mannosidase; Melanin; Pectate Lyase; Proteome; Secretome; Triacylglycerol Lipase; Unclassified Drug; Xylan Endo 1,3 Beta Xylosidase; Fungal Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Bioinformatics; Catabolite Repression; Cell Wall; Cellular Distribution; Controlled Study; Functional Proteomics; Fungal Virulence; Fungus Culture; Fungus Growth; Fungus Isolation; Geographic Origin; Glomerella Cingulata; Image Analysis; Molecular Weight; Nonhuman; Pathogenesis; Pathotype; Priority Journal; Protein Analysis; Protein Content; Protein Expression; Reproducibility; Transcription Regulation; Two Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis; Upregulation; Verticillium Albo-atrum; Verticillium Wilt; Xylem; Biological Model; Biology; Chemistry; Cluster Analysis; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant Disease; Secretion (process); Two Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis; Verticillium; Fungi; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-dimensional; Fungal Proteins; Models, Biological; Plant Diseases; Xylem","acetylcholinesterase; acetylesterase; enzyme; glucan synthase; mannosidase; melanin; pectate lyase; proteome; secretome; triacylglycerol lipase; unclassified drug; xylan endo 1,3 beta xylosidase; fungal protein; amino acid sequence; Article; bioinformatics; catabolite repression; cell wall; cellular distribution; controlled study; functional proteomics; fungal virulence; fungus culture; fungus growth; fungus isolation; geographic origin; Glomerella cingulata; image analysis; molecular weight; nonhuman; pathogenesis; pathotype; priority journal; protein analysis; protein content; protein expression; reproducibility; transcription regulation; two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; upregulation; Verticillium albo-atrum; Verticillium wilt; xylem; biological model; biology; chemistry; cluster analysis; metabolism; microbiology; plant disease; secretion (process); two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Verticillium; Fungi; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Fungal Proteins; Models, Biological; Plant Diseases; Xylem",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946164995

Although able to grow, this filament is cell cycle arrested on the plant surface. This cell cycle arrest is released once the filament penetrates the plant tissue. The reasons and mechanisms for this cell cycle arrest are unknown. Here, we have tried to address these questions. We reached three conclusions from our studies. First, the observed cell cycle arrest is the result of the cooperation of at least two distinct mechanisms: one involving the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) cascade; and the other relying on the transcriptional downregulation of Hsl1, a kinase that modulates the G2/M transition. Second, a sustained cell cycle arrest during the infective filament step is necessary for the virulence in U. maydis, as a strain unable to arrest the cell cycle was severely impaired in its ability to infect corn plants. Third, production of the appressorium, a structure required for plant penetration, is incompatible with an active cell cycle. The inability to infect plants by strains defective in cell cycle arrest seems to be caused by their failure to induce the appressorium formation process. In summary, our findings uncover genetic circuits to arrest the cell cycle during the growth of this fungus on the plant surface, thus allowing the penetration into plant tissue. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Appressorium; Cell Cycle; Ustilago Maydis; Virulence; Cyclic Amp Dependent Protein Kinase; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cyclic Amp Dependent Protein Kinase; Cell Cycle Protein; Article; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Arrest; Controlled Study; Dna Damage; Fungal Strain; Fungal Virulence; Fungus Growth; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoint; Maize; Mycosis; Nonhuman; Plant Disease; Plant Tissue; Ustilago Maydis; Cell Cycle Checkpoint; Cytoskeleton; Fluorescence Microscopy; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Network; Genetics; Image Processing; Metabolism; Microbiology; Pathogenicity; Physiology; Ustilago; Virulence; Fungi; Zea Mays; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cytoskeleton; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Plant Diseases; Virulence","cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cell cycle protein; Article; cell cycle; cell cycle arrest; controlled study; DNA damage; fungal strain; fungal virulence; fungus growth; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; maize; mycosis; nonhuman; plant disease; plant tissue; Ustilago maydis; cell cycle checkpoint; cytoskeleton; fluorescence microscopy; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; image processing; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; physiology; Ustilago; virulence; Fungi; Zea mays; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cytoskeleton; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Plant Diseases; Virulence",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919338045

The accurate recognition of honey pomelo leaf diseases is the premise of the treatment of honey pomelo diseases, and the precision directly affects the efficiency in controlling diseases. However, most of the current researches on disease recognition aimed at the global information of the study objects, but ignored the disease's local feature extraction in multi-scale and multi-direction; in addition, the present researches generally used the method of ""one to one"" or ""one to many"" when building many types of support vector machine (SVM) in the disease classification model, few researches used the method about SVM based on directed acyclic decision tree. So, leaf diseases recognition of honey pomelo based on SVM of directed acyclic decision tree was put forward in this paper. At first, statistical analysis on components of color characteristics of collected honey pomelo leaf diseases was carried on, and the conclusion was drawn according to the statistics of component B, component 2G-R-B, component (G+R+B)/3 and component Q in YIQ color model, which were easily distinguished among the 4 diseases, and so the 4 color components were used as disease color features. Secondly, honey pomelo leaf disease images were converted into 4 grayscale images of component B, component 2G-R-B, component (G+R+B)/3 and component Q in YIQ color model. Gabor wavelet with 5 dimensions and 8 directions was used for convolution calculation with 4 grayscale component images, and 16-dimension energy sub-band was got, the mean value of which was used as eigenvector. Disease recognition model of three-level directed acyclic decision tree SVM was constructed by 6 SVM classifiers, in order to recognize 4 honey pomelo diseases, i.e. maculopathy, anthracnose, scab and dark mildew. According to the test results of cross validation method, the recognition accuracies of maculopathy, anthracnose, scab and dark mildew respectively reached 90%, 96.66%, 93.33% and 96.66%, and the average recognition rate of the 4 diseases was 94.16%, showing that the method could effectively recognize the 4 honey pomelo leaf diseases. Optimal binary tree SVM proposed in this paper was compared with BP neural network, one-to-one SVM and one-to-many SVM in different characteristic dimensions, and the results showed that the training time of the proposed method in this paper and other 3 methods was respectively 740 ms, 420 ms, 450 ms and 370 ms, and the disease recognition accuracy of the 4 methods was respectively 86%, 91.5%, 90% and 94.16%. The method proposed in this paper is superior to the other 3 algorithms in training time and recognition precision. So the proposed method can provide technical support for the accurate recognition of honey pomelo leaf diseases, in favor of the prevention and treatment of pomelo diseases, and also provide references for the prevention and cure of other plant's leaf diseases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Diseases; Gabor Wavelet; Identification; Image Processing; Optimal Binary Tree; Pomelo Leaf; Support Vector Machines; Backpropagation; Binary Trees; Classification (of Information); Color; Color Codes; Decision Trees; Fruits; Fungi; Identification (control Systems); Image Processing; Support Vector Machines; Color Characteristics; Cross-validation Methods; Disease Classification; Gabor Wavelets; Local Feature Extraction; Pomelo Leaf; Prevention And Cure; Recognition Accuracy; Diseases,Backpropagation; Binary trees; Classification (of information); Color; Color codes; Decision trees; Fruits; Fungi; Identification (control systems); Image processing; Support vector machines; Color characteristics; Cross-validation methods; Disease classification; Gabor wavelets; Local feature extraction; Pomelo leaf; Prevention and cure; Recognition accuracy; Diseases,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910036453

Decades of research on the molecular basis of pathogenesis focused on a limited number of factors associated with long-known host-microbe interaction systems, providing limited direction into this challenge. Computational approaches to identify virulence genes often rely on two strategies: searching for sequence similarity to known host-microbe interaction factors from other organisms, and identifying islands of genes that discriminate between pathogens of one type and closely related non-pathogens or pathogens of a different type. The former is limited to known genes, excluding vast collections of genes of unknown function found in every genome. The latter lacks specificity, since many genes in genomic islands have little to do with host-interaction.Result: In this study, we developed a supervised machine learning approach that was designed to recognize patterns from large and disparate data types, in order to identify candidate host-microbe interaction factors. The soft rot Enterobacteriaceae strains Dickeya dadantii 3937 and Pectobacterium carotovorum WPP14 were used for development of this tool, because these pathogens are important on multiple high value crops in agriculture worldwide and more genomic and functional data is available for the Enterobacteriaceae than any other microbial family. Our approach achieved greater than 90% precision and a recall rate over 80% in 10-fold cross validation tests.Conclusion: Application of the learning scheme to the complete genome of these two organisms generated a list of roughly 200 candidates, many of which were previously not implicated in plant-microbe interaction and many of which are of completely unknown function. These lists provide new targets for experimental validation and further characterization, and our approach presents a promising pattern-learning scheme that can be generalized to create a resource to study host-microbe interactions in other bacterial phytopathogens. © 2014 Ma et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Mining; Enterobacteria; Genome Scale Analysis; Pattern Recognition; Plant Pathogen; Virulence Factors; Bacterial Protein; Protein Astb; Protein Atsr; Protein Avrm; Protein Cbsh; Protein Chmx; Protein Dlta; Protein Dltb; Protein Dltd; Protein Ganc; Protein Ganf; Protein Gang; Protein Hase; Protein Heca2; Protein Inh; Protein Nipe; Protein Occq; Protein Ppda; Protein Sftp; Protein Sttg; Protein Virb1; Protein Virb10; Protein Virb11; Protein Virb2; Protein Virb4; Protein Virb6; Protein Virb7; Protein Virb8; Protein Virb9; Unclassified Drug; Virulence Factor; Article; Automated Pattern Recognition; Bacterial Genome; Binding Site; Dickeya Dadantii; Enterobacteriaceae; Functional Genomics; Gene Ontology; Host Pathogen Interaction; Machine Learning; Measurement Accuracy; Nonhuman; Pectobacterium Carotovorum; Plant Pathogen Interaction; Protein Analysis; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Sequence Homology; Soft Rot; Validation Study; Artificial Intelligence; Bacterial Gene; Biology; Genetics; Genomics; Microbiology; Plant Disease; Procedures; Reproducibility; Virulence; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Biology; Genes, Bacterial; Genomics; Host-pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Reproducibility Of Results; Roc Curve; Virulence; Virulence Factors","bacterial protein; protein astB; protein atsR; protein avrM; protein cbsH; protein chmX; protein dltA; protein dltB; protein dltD; protein ganC; protein ganF; protein ganG; protein hasE; protein hecA2; protein inh; protein nipE; protein occQ; protein ppdA; protein sftP; protein sttG; protein virB1; protein virB10; protein virB11; protein virB2; protein VirB4; protein virB6; protein virB7; protein virB8; protein virB9; unclassified drug; virulence factor; article; automated pattern recognition; bacterial genome; binding site; Dickeya dadantii; Enterobacteriaceae; functional genomics; gene ontology; host pathogen interaction; machine learning; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; Pectobacterium carotovorum; plant pathogen interaction; protein analysis; receiver operating characteristic; sequence homology; soft rot; validation study; artificial intelligence; bacterial gene; biology; genetics; genomics; microbiology; plant disease; procedures; reproducibility; virulence; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Biology; Genes, Bacterial; Genomics; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Virulence; Virulence Factors",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902758571

Neofusicoccum parvum and Diplodia seriata are among the causal agents. Vine green stems were artificially infected with N. parvum or D. seriata at the onset of three different phenological stages (G stage (separated clusters), flowering and veraison). Highest mean lesion lengths were recorded at flowering. Major proteome changes associated to artificial infections during the three different phenological stages were also reported using two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D)-based analysis. Twenty (G stage), 15 (flowering) and 13 (veraison) differentially expressed protein spots were subjected to nanoLC-MS/MS and a total of 247, 54 and 25 proteins were respectively identified. At flowering, a weaker response to the infection was likely activated as compared to the other stages, and some defense-related proteins were even down regulated (e.g., superoxide dismutase, major latex-like protein, and pathogenesis related protein 10). Globally, the flowering period seemed to represent the period of highest sensitivity of grapevine to Botryosphaeria dieback agent infection, possibly being related to the high metabolic activity in the inflorescences. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Botryosphaeria Dieback; Defense-related Proteins; Diplodia Seriata; Neofusicoccum Parvum; Plant Proteomics; Two Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis; 4 Aminobutyric Acid; Catalase; Fructose; Glucose; Glutathione Transferase; Glycosidase; Peroxidase; Peroxiredoxin; Protein Disulfide Isomerase; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase; Ribulosebisphosphate Carboxylase; S Adenosylhomocysteine; S Adenosylmethionine; Sucrose; Plant Proteins; Proteome; 4 Aminobutyric Acid; Catalase; Chaperonin; Fructose; Glucose; Glutathione Transferase; Glycosidase; Peroxidase; Peroxiredoxin; Protein Disulfide Isomerase; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase; Ribulosebisphosphate Carboxylase; S Adenosylhomocysteine; S Adenosylmethionine; Sucrose; Proteome; Vegetable Protein; Amino Acid Metabolism; Article; Botryosphaeria Dieback; Controlled Study; Diplodia Seriata; Down Regulation; Flowering; Fungal Plant Disease; Fungal Virulence; Fungus; Gene Expression; Image Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Necrosis; Neofusicoccum Parvum; Nonhuman; Nucleotide Sequence; Oxidative Stress; Photosynthesis; Protein Analysis; Protein Expression; Signal Transduction; Two Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis; Upregulation; Ascomycetes; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Microbiology; Physiology; Plant Disease; Proteomics; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Vitis; Ascomycota; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-dimensional; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Tandem Mass Spectrometry","4 aminobutyric acid; catalase; chaperonin; fructose; glucose; glutathione transferase; glycosidase; peroxidase; peroxiredoxin; protein disulfide isomerase; pyruvate dehydrogenase; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; s adenosylhomocysteine; s adenosylmethionine; sucrose; proteome; vegetable protein; amino acid metabolism; article; Botryosphaeria dieback; controlled study; Diplodia seriata; down regulation; flowering; fungal plant disease; fungal virulence; fungus; gene expression; image analysis; mass spectrometry; necrosis; Neofusicoccum parvum; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; protein analysis; protein expression; signal transduction; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; upregulation; Ascomycetes; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; plant disease; proteomics; tandem mass spectrometry; Vitis; Ascomycota; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901781672

In plant hosts, the viral proteins have several basic science implications and biotechnology applications. However in silico identification of these proteins is limited by their high sequence diversity. In this study we developed supervised learning based classification models for plant viral RNA silencing suppressor proteins in plant viruses. We developed four classifiers based on supervised learning algorithms: J48, Random Forest, LibSVM and Naïve Bayes algorithms, with enriched model learning by correlation based feature selection. Structural and physicochemical features calculated for experimentally verified primary protein sequences were used to train the classifiers. The training features include amino acid composition; auto correlation coefficients; composition, transition, and distribution of various physicochemical properties; and pseudo amino acid composition. Performance analysis of predictive models based on 10 fold cross-validation and independent data testing revealed that the Random Forest based model was the best and achieved 86.11% overall accuracy and 86.22% balanced accuracy with a remarkably high area under the Receivers Operating Characteristic curve of 0.95 to predict viral RNA silencing suppressor proteins. The prediction models for plant viral RNA silencing suppressors can potentially aid identification of novel viral RNA silencing suppressors, which will provide valuable insights into the mechanism of RNA silencing and could be further explored as potential targets for designing novel antiviral therapeutics. Also, the key subset of identified optimal features may help in determining compositional patterns in the viral proteins which are important determinants for RNA silencing suppressor activities.

Careful sample preparation is therefore required to enable researchers to maximize the information gained from advances in fluorescent protein labeling, cell dyes and innovations in microscope technologies and techniques. We have previously shown that mounting leaves in the non-toxic, non-fluorescent perfluorocarbon (PFC), perfluorodecalin (PFD) enhances the optical properties of the leaf with minimal impact on physiology. Here, we assess the use of the PFCs, PFD, and perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene (PP11) for in vivo plant leaf imaging using four advanced modes of microscopy: laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), two-photon fluorescence microscopy, second harmonic generation microscopy, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. For every mode of imaging tested, we observed an improved signal when leaves were mounted in PFD or in PP11, compared to mounting the samples in water. Using an image analysis technique based on autocorrelation to quantitatively assess LSCM image deterioration with depth, we show that PP11 outperformed PFD as a mounting medium by enabling the acquisition of clearer images deeper into the tissue. In addition, we show that SRS microscopy can be used to image PFCs directly in the mesophyll and thereby easily delimit the ""negative space"" within a leaf, which may have important implications for studies of leaf development. Direct comparison of on and off resonance SRS micrographs show that PFCs do not to form intracellular aggregates in live plants.We conclude that the application of PFCs as mounting media substantially increases advanced microscopy image quality of living mesophyll and leaf vascular bundle cells. © 2014 Littlejohn, Mansfield, Christmas,Witterick, Fricker, Grant, Smirnoff, Everson, Moger and Love. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Arabidopsis; Confocal; Imaging; Microscopy; Multi-photon; Perfluorocarbon; Perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901032720

A mesophyll colonizer, Xoc differs from X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which invades xylem to cause bacterial blight of rice. Both produce multiple distinct TAL effectors, type III-delivered proteins that transactivate effector-specific host genes. A TAL effector finds its target(s) via a partially degenerate code whereby the modular effector amino acid sequence identifies nucleotide sequences to which the protein binds. Virulence contributions of some Xoo TAL effectors have been shown, and their relevant targets, susceptibility (S) genes, identified, but the role of TAL effectors in leaf streak is uncharacterized. We used host transcript profiling to compare leaf streak to blight and to probe functions of Xoc TAL effectors. We found that Xoc and Xoo induce almost completely different host transcriptional changes. Roughly one in three genes upregulated by the pathogens is preceded by a candidate TAL effector binding element. Experimental analysis of the 44 such genes predicted to be Xoc TAL effector targets verified nearly half, and identified most others as false predictions. None of the Xoc targets is a known bacterial blight S gene. Mutational analysis revealed that Tal2g, which activates two genes, contributes to lesion expansion and bacterial exudation. Use of designer TAL effectors discriminated a sulfate transporter gene as the S gene. Across all targets, basal expression tended to be higher than genome-average, and induction moderate. Finally, machine learning applied to real vs. falsely predicted targets yielded a classifier that recalled 92% of the real targets with 88% precision, providing a tool for better target prediction in the future. Our study expands the number of known TAL effector targets, identifies a new class of S gene, and improves our ability to predict functional targeting. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Transcription Activator Like Effector; Transcription Factor; Unclassified Drug; Article; Bacterial Blight; Bacterial Leaf Streak; Bacterial Virulence; Bacterium Transformation; Controlled Study; Dna Microarray; Dna Polymorphism; Gene Expression; Gene Ontology; Genetic Susceptibility; Hybridization; Mutational Analysis; Nonhuman; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Protein Binding; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Type Iii Secretion System; Upregulation; Xanthomonas Oryzae; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Disease Resistance; Dna Mutational Analysis; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genes, Plant; Host-pathogen Interactions; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oryza Sativa; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Xanthomonas","transcription activator like effector; transcription factor; unclassified drug; article; bacterial blight; bacterial leaf streak; bacterial virulence; bacterium transformation; controlled study; DNA microarray; DNA polymorphism; gene expression; gene ontology; genetic susceptibility; hybridization; mutational analysis; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; protein binding; real time polymerase chain reaction; type III secretion system; upregulation; Xanthomonas oryzae; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Disease Resistance; DNA Mutational Analysis; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genes, Plant; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oryza sativa; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Xanthomonas",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897731029

The wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici is important worldwide, but little is known about the genetic architecture of pathogenicity, including the production of melanin. Because melanin production can exhibit complex inheritance, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in two crosses to identify the underlying genes. Restriction site2associated DNA sequencing was used to genotype 263 (cross 1) and 261 (cross 2) progeny at ~8500 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and construct two dense linkage maps. We measured gray values, representing degrees of melanization, for single-spore colonies growing on Petri dishes by using a novel image-processing approach that enabled high-throughput phenotyping. Because melanin production can be affected by stress, each offspring was grown in two stressful environments and one control environment. We detected six significant QTL in cross 1 and nine in cross 2, with three QTL shared between the crosses. Different QTL were identified in different environments and at different colony ages. By obtaining complete genome sequences for the four parents and analyzing sequence variation in the QTL confidence intervals, we identified 16 candidate genes likely to affect melanization. One of these candidates was PKS1, a polyketide synthase gene known to play a role in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene melanin. Three candidate quantitative trait nucleotides were identified in PKS1. Many of the other candidate genes were not previously associated with melanization. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","(radseq); Analysis; Automated; Digital Image; Dna; Genetic Linkage; Graminicola; Map; Mycosphaerella; Qtl; Restriction; Sequencing; Site-associated; Amino Acid; Melanin; Polyketide Synthase; Melanins; Plant Proteins; Polyketide Synthases; Amino Acid; Melanin; Polyketide Synthase; Vegetable Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Chromosome 10; Chromosome 11; Chromosome 13; Chromosome 4; Chromosome 8; Controlled Study; Dna Sequence; Gene Frequency; Gene Identification; Gene Mapping; Genetic Distance; Genetic Linkage; Genetic Recombination; Genotype; Image Processing; Melanogenesis; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Progeny; Quantitative Trait; Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping; Restriction Site; Segregation Distortion; Sequence Alignment; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Supernumerary Chromosome; Zymoseptoria Tritici; Biosynthesis; Chemistry; Chromosome Map; Fungal Gene; Genetics; Isolation And Purification; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant Disease; Protein Database; Quantitative Trait Locus; Saccharomycetales; Wheat; Fungi; Graminicola; Mycosphaerella; Triticum Aestivum; Chromosome Mapping; Databases, Protein; Genes, Fungal; Genetic Linkage; Genotype; Melanins; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Polyketide Synthases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Sequence Analysis, Dna; Triticum","amino acid; melanin; polyketide synthase; vegetable protein; amino acid sequence; Article; chromosome 10; chromosome 11; chromosome 13; chromosome 4; chromosome 8; controlled study; DNA sequence; gene frequency; gene identification; gene mapping; genetic distance; genetic linkage; genetic recombination; genotype; image processing; melanogenesis; nonhuman; phenotype; progeny; quantitative trait; quantitative trait locus mapping; restriction site; segregation distortion; sequence alignment; single nucleotide polymorphism; supernumerary chromosome; Zymoseptoria tritici; biosynthesis; chemistry; chromosome map; fungal gene; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; plant disease; protein database; quantitative trait locus; Saccharomycetales; wheat; Fungi; Graminicola; Mycosphaerella; Triticum aestivum; Chromosome Mapping; Databases, Protein; Genes, Fungal; Genetic Linkage; Genotype; Melanins; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Polyketide Synthases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Triticum",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964315075

Field monitoring of plant disease is the foremost step which provides quantized evaluation of disease severity for fungicide spraying guidance. However, there are challenges of lacking of continuity, robustness, and precision in field detection due to complex real field environment and non-rigid plant object. Different from current disease detection algorithms, our proposed method combined with two frameworks of OCM and supporter vector machine (SVM), which achieves good robustness and continuity for single-leaf based CLS observation to resist environment and plant variations. In first framework, we employ the robust template matching method of OCM for tracking a single leaf from a holistic plant throughout a time sequence field plant images. In the second framework, a three-dimensional (3D) feature, which integrates pixel-based intensity of L, acomponents in Labcolor space and region-based orientation code entropy with density derived from orientation code histogram, is as input into SVM classifier for CLS classification from complex-sandy soil background. Furthermore, we implemented a real field experiment and test the proposed method with field beet images. Experiment results shows that our integrated frameworks perform well for continuous CLS detection and quantization under complex real-field conditions. Besides, the robust observation of foliar disease development will facilitate better analysis of disease mechanism detection and fungicide-spraying guidance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cercospora Leaf Spot (cls); Disease Detection; Image Analysis; Orientation Code Matching (ocm); Robustness; Sugar Beet; Support Vector Machine (svm); Agricultural Machinery; Codes (symbols); Experiments; Fungicides; Image Analysis; Robustness (control Systems); Sugar Beets; Support Vector Machines; Template Matching; Disease Detection; Environmental Conditions; Fungicide Spraying; Integrated Frameworks; Leaf Spots; Orientation Code Matching; Robust Observation; Template Matching Method; Image Matching,Agricultural machinery; Codes (symbols); Experiments; Fungicides; Image analysis; Robustness (control systems); Sugar beets; Support vector machines; Template matching; Disease detection; Environmental conditions; Fungicide spraying; Integrated frameworks; Leaf spots; Orientation code matching; Robust observation; Template matching method; Image matching,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911921671

Experimental results with high precision and recall rates demonstrate the feasibility and potential of our proposed algorithm, which could be further implemented in real sugar beet fields with robust detection and precise quantization of foliar disease development, for better analysis of disease mechanism and optimal fungicide-spraying management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cercospora Leaf Spot (cls); Disease Detection; Image Analysis; Orientation Code Matching (ocm); Sugar Beet; Support Vector Machine (svm); Image Analysis; Image Retrieval; Support Vector Machines; Template Matching; Agricultural Machinery; Image Matching; Disease Classification; Disease Detection; Disease Development; Leaf Spots; Orientation Code Matching; Precision And Recall; Sugar Beet Fields; Template Matching Method; Sugar Beets; Algorithm; Bioengineering; Detection Method; Disease Prevalence; Fungal Disease; Pixel; Sugar Beet; Disease Incidence; Fungicide; Image Analysis; Beta Vulgaris Subsp.

High temperature negatively affects different stages of plant development in rice, mainly booting and flowering. Identifying candidate genes associated with high-temperature stress response may provide knowledge for the improvement of heat tolerance in rice. As the rice genome sequencing has already been undertaken, a major work challenge is annotating proteins and decoding their functionalities. MAP kinase (MAPK) proteins are involved in signaling various abiotic and biotic stresses, like temperature stress or drought, wounding and pathogen infection. Moreover, MAPKs have also been implicated in cell cycle and developmental processes. In this study, an attempt has been made in developing a MAP kinase prediction tool for rice, MapPred. The computational approach has been developed using Sequential Minimum Optimization (SMO) algorithm in Weka workbench, and a sensitivity of 100% was obtained using dipeptide method. MapPred was also tested with three plants, namely Arabidopsis, maize and tomato to prove that developed tool has higher accuracy with rice than other plants which further proves the higher prediction accuracy of species-specific tools. Prediction performance of MapPred was evaluated using cross validation, independent data test and leave one out validation. Our experimental results demonstrated that proposed algorithm based on dipeptide method could be very effective in the computational approach for predicting MAPK proteins in Oryza sativasubsp.indica. © 2014 IEEE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bioinformatics; Computational Methods; Enzymes; Forecasting; Peptides; Plants (botany); Computational Approach; High Temperature Stress; Machine Learning Approaches; Pathogen Infection; Prediction Accuracy; Prediction Performance; Sequential Minimum Optimizations; Temperature Stress; Artificial Intelligence,Bioinformatics; Computational methods; Enzymes; Forecasting; Peptides; Plants (botany); Computational approach; High temperature stress; Machine learning approaches; Pathogen infection; Prediction accuracy; Prediction performance; Sequential minimum optimizations; Temperature stress; Artificial intelligence,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904439074

We tested the hypothesis that the fungus generates high turgor pressure in its hyaline appressoria to mechanically pierce epidermal cells. Turgor pressure was determined by a microscopic technique, called transmitted light double-beam interference Mach-Zehnder microscopy (MZM), which was developed in the 1960s as a forefront of live cell imaging. We revitalized some original microscopes and equipped them for modern image capturing. MZM data were corroborated by cytorrhysis experiments. Incipient cytorrhysis determined the turgor pressure in appressoria of P. pachyrhizi to be equivalent to 5.13 MPa. MZM data revealed that osmotically active sugar alcohols only accounted for 75% of this value. Despite having a lower turgor pressure, hyaline rust appressoria were able to penetrate non-biodegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes more efficiently than do melanized appressoria of the anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum graminicola or the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Our findings challenge the hypotheses that force-based penetration is a specific hallmark of fungi differentiating melanized appressoria and that this turgor-driven process is solely caused by metabolic degradation products. The appressorial turgor pressure may explain the capability of P. pachyrhizi to forcefully invade a wide range of different plants and may pave the way to novel plant protection approaches. © 2014 New Phytologist Trust. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Appressorial Turgor Pressure; Asian Soybean Rust (phakopsora Pachyrhizi); Cytorrhysis; Interferometry; Melanin; Penetration By Force; Sugar Alcohols; Glycogen; Politef; Glycogen; Membranes, Artificial; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Sugar Alcohols; Assessment Method; Biodegradation; Ethylene; Fungal Disease; Interferometry; Melanin; Metabolism; Microscopy; Soybean; Sugar; Fungi; Glomerella Graminicola; Glycine Max; Magnaporthe Grisea; Magnaporthe Oryzae; Phakopsora Pachyrhizi; Uredinales; Artificial Membrane; Glycogen; Politef; Sugar Alcohol; Basidiomycetes; Chemistry; Devices; Germination; Host Pathogen Interaction; Image Processing; Magnaporthe; Mass Fragmentography; Microbiology; Osmosis; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Procedures; Basidiomycota; Gas Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Germination; Glycogen; Host-pathogen Interactions; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Interferometry; Membranes, Artificial; Osmosis; Plant Diseases; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Soybeans; Sugar Alcohols","assessment method; biodegradation; ethylene; fungal disease; interferometry; melanin; metabolism; microscopy; soybean; sugar; Fungi; Glomerella graminicola; Glycine max; Magnaporthe grisea; Magnaporthe oryzae; Phakopsora pachyrhizi; Uredinales; artificial membrane; glycogen; politef; sugar alcohol; Basidiomycetes; chemistry; devices; germination; host pathogen interaction; image processing; Magnaporthe; mass fragmentography; microbiology; osmosis; pathogenicity; plant disease; procedures; Basidiomycota; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Germination; Glycogen; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Interferometry; Membranes, Artificial; Osmosis; Plant Diseases; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Soybeans; Sugar Alcohols",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902532609

Nevertheless, current protocols for the immunological detection of viral diseases with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in plants take between 3 and 6 days and are therefore not suited for rapid diagnosis of virus diseases in plants. In this study, we describe a method that allows rapid cytohistochemical detection of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in leaves of tobacco plants.With the help of microwave irradiation, sample preparation of the leaves was reduced to 90 min. After sample sectioning, virus particles were stained on the sections by immunogold labelling of the viral coat protein, which took 100 min. After investigation with the TEM, a clear visualization of TMV in tobacco cells was achieved altogether in about half a day. Comparison of gold particle density by image analysis revealed that samples prepared with the help of microwave irradiation yielded significantly higher gold particle density as samples prepared conventionally at room temperature.This study clearly demonstrates that microwave-assisted plant sample preparation in combination with cytohistochemical localization of viral coat protein is well suited for rapid diagnosis of plant virus diseases in altogether about half a day by TEM. © The Author 2013.

Oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate by Rubisco leads to the formation of large amounts of 2-phosphoglycolate, which are recycled to 3-phosphoglycerate by the photorespiratory C<inf>2</inf> cycle, concomitant with stoichiometric production rates of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in peroxisomes. Apart from its significance for agricultural productivity, a secondary function of photorespiration in pathogen defence has emerged only recently. Here, we summarise literature data supporting the crosstalk between photorespiration and pathogen defence and perform a meta-expression analysis of photorespiratory genes during pathogen attack. Moreover, we screened Arabidopsis proteins newly predicted using machine learning methods to be targeted to peroxisomes, the central H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-producing organelle of photorespiration, for homologues of known pathogen defence proteins and analysed their expression during pathogen infection.

They are responsible for a severe degeneration of grapevines that occurs in most vineyards worldwide. Although sharing a high level of sequence identity between their CP, ArMV is transmitted exclusively by the ectoparasitic nematode Xiphinema diversicaudatum whereas GFLV is specifically transmitted by the nematode X. index. The structural determinants involved in the transmission specificity of both viruses map solely to their respective CP. Recently, reverse genetic and crystallographic studies on GFLV revealed that a positively charged pocket in the CP B domain located at the virus surface may be responsible for vector specificity. To go further into delineating the coat protein determinants involved in transmission specificity, we determined the 6.5. å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of ArMV and used homology modeling and flexible fitting approaches to build its pseudo-atomic structure. This study allowed us to resolve ArMV CP architecture and delineate connections between ArMV capsid shell and its RNA. Comparison of ArMV and GFLV CPs reveals structural differences in the B domain pocket, thus strengthening the hypothesis of a key role of this region in the viral transmission specificity and identifies new potential functional domains of Nepovirus capsid. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Arabis Mosaic Virus; Cryo-electron Microscopy; Image Processing; Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting; Nematode Transmission; Nepovirus; Capsid Proteins; Rna, Viral; Capsid Protein; Coat Protein; Virus Rna; Arabis; Arabis Mosaic Virus; Article; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Crystal Structure; Grapevine Fanleaf Virus; Mosaic Virus; Nepovirus; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Protein Rna Binding; Three Dimensional Imaging; Virus Capsid; Virus Morphology; Virus Transmission; Vitivirus; Animals; Capsid; Capsid Proteins; Enoplida; Models, Molecular; Mosaic Viruses; Plant Diseases; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Rna, Viral; Arabis Mosaic Virus; Miridae; Picorna; Xiphinema Diversicaudatum","capsid protein; coat protein; virus RNA; Arabis; arabis mosaic virus; article; cryoelectron microscopy; crystal structure; Grapevine fanleaf virus; Mosaic virus; Nepovirus; nonhuman; priority journal; protein RNA binding; three dimensional imaging; virus capsid; virus morphology; virus transmission; Vitivirus; Animals; Capsid; Capsid Proteins; Enoplida; Models, Molecular; Mosaic Viruses; Plant Diseases; Protein Structure, Tertiary; RNA, Viral; Arabis mosaic virus; Miridae; Picorna; Xiphinema diversicaudatum",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875052798

The harvest can significantly vary from year to year and also within the vineyard due to soil conditions, disease, pests, climate and variation in vineyard management practices. Current practices for yield and quality estimation are destructive, expensive, inaccurate and largely subjective. These factors make the production of high quality grapes for wine making challenging. Image analysis has the potential to provide an inexpensive, nondestructive way of capturing precise information about the entire vineyard. This paper presents a review of recent research relevant to the application of digital image analysis to the management of vineyards focusing on the key challenges for in-field, on the vine, ground level image capture and analysis. The applications explored are: Yield Estimation: Historically efforts have primarily been focused on the objective estimation of harvest yield. In order to estimate yield using image processing the grapes must be detected, segmented from the background and the number of clusters counted and the size of the cluster determined and this is typically how most estimation methods, using images, are approached. However for accurate yield forecasting berries within the cluster must be counted and the size of each berry determined. This is difficult to achieve due to the occlusion of berries. Many of the most successful grape detection methods have been developed, independently of the work on yield forecasting, for the automation of vineyard management activities such as harvesting and smart spraying rather than for yield estimation. Quality Evaluation: Berry quality can be linked to visual properties such as the size, weight and colour of the berry. These properties have been proven to be indicators for ripeness and level of phenolics, flavonoids and sugar. To date most of the work in this area has focused on the processing of images of individual grapes in the laboratory. In the natural environment approaches must be able to cope with difficult and variable lighting conditions and with factors such as occlusion of the grapes within the cluster and by the canopy. Disease Detection: While some work has been undertaken towards the detection of powdery and downy mildew and botrytis in grapes there is still significant scope for improvement. Detection in the field is difficult as the grapes may be covered by bloom and disease can exhibit different signs and symptoms depending on the grape variety and the stage of development of the disease. Moreover, more than one disease might be present. Current work does not address the issues of more than one disease or identification of the disease at various stages in its development. The most successful work to date has not been on in-field images. Grape Phenology: The phenology of the grape vine is complex. Understanding the phenology of a given plant system is important in determining the ability of a region to produce a crop and knowledge of a plant's growth stages is advantageous as management practices (such as irrigation, pest and disease control and pruning) can be applied at optimum times in the vines growth cycle. Additionally, information regarding growth stages can be useful in forecasting crop yields and even quality. The information gathered from automated, fast, accurate image analysis from in-field images could be used to design, train and validate simulations and forecasting models of vineyards and grape phenology. This type of research is at the forefront of climate research in which novel methods are required to monitor spatiotemporal physiological responses of food sources to changes in the environment. The use of image processing to enhance vineyard practices and forecast the success and or quality of wine grapes is in its infancy. While much of the work to date is promising we have not yet achieved the “vineyard of the future”, where image analysis (image and video) is a powerful tool that is adopted by viticulturists to inform the management of their vineyards. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Classification; Image Processing; Viticulture; Biology; Classification (of Information); Crops; Disease Control; Forecasting; Fruits; Harvesting; Image Enhancement; Image Processing; Operations Research; Physiological Models; Quality Control; Wine; Development And Applications; Digital Image Analysis; Economic Importance; Management Practices; Natural Environments; Objective Estimations; Physiological Response; Viticulture; Image Analysis,Biology; Classification (of information); Crops; Disease control; Forecasting; Fruits; Harvesting; Image enhancement; Image processing; Operations research; Physiological models; Quality control; Wine; Development and applications; Digital image analysis; Economic importance; Management practices; Natural environments; Objective estimations; Physiological response; Viticulture; Image analysis,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080875869

Compared to traditional multispectral data, it offers a continuous coverage of electromagnetic spectra within their spectral range, where the so-called ""spectral signatures"" of the surface are acquired rather than discrete values within broad spectral bands. This allows a development of new methods for Earth surface object detection including a high accuracy target detection and/or quantitative retrieval of surface properties. The application of hyperspectral remote sensing data in the scientific and even the commercial community for creation of maps is quite broad - from agriculture (yield prediction and precise farming), forestry (forest health status, biomass estimation, species composition mapping) through geology (e.g. mapping of minerals, land degradation assessment), up to limnology (e.g. water quality evaluation), and other domain (e.g. military). Numbers of hyperspectral data providers are now present for surveys in Europe. However, each is using specific processing chain and harmonized quality indicators and quality layers accompanying hyperspectral data are often missing. That was the rationale for formation of the Joint Research Activity JRA2 ""HYQUAPRO"" within the FP7 EUFAR project (http://www.eufar.net). JRA2 was focused on developing of standardized quality layers for hyperspectral data. Partners of HYQUAPRO are among others PML/NERC, INTA, DLR, VITO/RSL, CVGZ - GzechGlobe, TAU, FUB, so all major processing facilities for airborne hyperspectral image data in Europe are included. Finally 13 quality layers were agreed to be a common base, which each hyperspectral data provider should incorporate into the processing chain. According to differences among sensors and data processing approaches, each data provider may include additional quality layers, specific to their pre-processing chain. Since 2004, the Global Change Research Centre - CzechGlobe (CVGZ, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic) has been operating the VNIR airborne hyperspectral sensor AISA Eagle. The AISA Eagle system is being produced by Spectral Imaging (Specim Ltd, Finland) company. A typical pre-processing of airborne hyperspectral data will be demonstrated in pre-processing chain which has been established at CzechGlobe including quality layers developed for the CzechGlobe pre-processing chain. © SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy; Hyperspectral Data Processing; Quality Layers; Data Processing; Exhibitions; Forestry; Object Recognition; Remote Sensing; Spectroscopy; Water Quality; Airborne Hyperspectral Data; Airborne Hyperspectral Remote Sensing; Airborne Imaging; Hyperspectral Data; Hyperspectral Image Datas; Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data; Quality Layers; Water Quality Evaluation; Chains; Air Craft; Data Processing; Image Analysis; Pattern Recognition; Water Quality,Data processing; Exhibitions; Forestry; Object recognition; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Water quality; Airborne hyperspectral data; Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing; Airborne imaging; Hyperspectral Data; Hyperspectral image datas; Hyperspectral remote sensing data; Quality layers; Water quality evaluation; Chains; Air Craft; Data Processing; Image Analysis; Pattern Recognition; Water Quality,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892589357

The disease is most successfully countered by the introduction of genetic tolerance into elite sugar beet hybrids. To this end, breeding programmes require high quality biological assays allowing discrimination of minor differences between plants within a segregating population. This study describes the successful implementation of image analysis software in the bioassays for quantification of necrotic lesions at different stages of C. beticola infection, allowing selection on minor phenotypic differences during the sugar beet breeding process for C. beticola resistance. In addition, a real-time PCR assay was developed for the quantification of C. beticola pathogen biomass in infected beet canopy. The use of both techniques, even in an early stage of infection, fine-tunes current bioassays, allowing more accurate and efficient selection of resistant breeding material. © 2011 The Authors.

To ameliorate these losses, there is a need to identify infections in early stages. Recent developments in next generation nucleic acid sequencing and mass spectrometry open the door to screening plants by the sequences of their macromolecules. Such an approach requires the ability to recognize the organismal origin of unknown DNA or peptide fragments. There are many ways to approach this problem but none have emerged as the best protocol. Here we attempt a systematic way to determine organismal origins of peptides by using a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm that we implement is a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The amino acid compositions of proteobacterial proteins were found to be different from those of plant proteins. We developed an SVM model based on amino acid and dipeptide compositions to distinguish between a proteobacterial protein and a plant protein. The amino acid composition (AAC) based SVM model had an accuracy of 92.44% with 0.85 Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) while the dipeptide composition (DC) based SVM model had a maximum accuracy of 94.67% and 0.89 MCC. We also developed SVM models based on a hybrid approach (AAC and DC), which gave a maximum accuracy 94.86% and a 0.90 MCC. The models were tested on unseen or untrained datasets to assess their validity. The results indicate that the SVM based on the AAC and DC hybrid approach can be used to distinguish proteobacterial from plant protein sequences.

The diseased oil palm plants normally shows a range of symptoms such as coloured spots or streaks that will occur on the leaves, stems, and seeds of the plant. At present, in the agricultural sectors, diagnosing the type disease of plants are based on human expert, which is alongside with the conventional method applied using test device and performing laboratory test. Therefore, the needs in new approach to classify type of diseases are preferable. Hence, the aim of this paper is to focus on an innovative method based on image processing technique for classifying the lack of nutritional disease occurred in oil palm leaves by analyzing the leave surface only. The result is usable as a guide for fertilization since the trees respond rapidly to the applied fertilizers. The main important concern is to ensure the sufficient amount of fertilizer since excessive intake of fertilizers will cause toxicity to trees and indirectly increase cost of fertilizers. Images of oil palm leaves will be captured using high-end digital imaging device to analyse the leaves surface. Further, feature extraction algorithms also will develop based on shape, texture, and colour of the disease type. The feature vectors will be attained acting as inputs to fuzzy classifier. Overall, the proposed method will benefit the oil palm industries to fulfill the industry demand. © 2011 IEEE. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Elaeis Guineensis; Fertilizers; Image Processing; Macronutrients; Nutrient Deficiencies; Agricultural Sector; Common Problems; Conventional Methods; Digital Imaging Devices; Elaeis Guineensis; Feature Extraction Algorithms; Feature Vectors; Fuzzy Classifiers; Human Expert; Image Processing Technique; Innovative Method; Laboratory Test; Macronutrients; Nutrient Deficiencies; Nutrient Deficiency; Oil Palm; Plant Disease; Processing Approach; Test Device; Feature Extraction; Image Processing; Nutrients; Plant Extracts; Systems Engineering; Fertilizers,Agricultural sector; Common problems; Conventional methods; Digital imaging devices; Elaeis guineensis; Feature extraction algorithms; Feature vectors; Fuzzy classifiers; Human expert; Image processing technique; Innovative method; Laboratory test; macronutrients; nutrient deficiencies; Nutrient deficiency; Oil palm; Plant disease; Processing approach; Test device; Feature extraction; Image processing; Nutrients; Plant extracts; Systems engineering; Fertilizers,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052859539

The fungus produces the host-specific, chlorosis-inducing toxin Ptr ToxB. To better understand toxin action, we examined the effects of Ptr ToxB on sensitive wheat. Photosynthesis, as measured by infrared gas analysis, declined significantly within 12 h of toxin treatment, prior to the development of chlorosis at 48-72 h. Analysis by 2-DE revealed a total of 102 protein spots with significantly altered intensities 12-36 h after toxin treatment, of which 66 were more abundant and 36 were less abundant than in the buffer-treated control. The identities of 47 of these spots were established by MS/MS, and included proteins involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle, and the stress/defense response. Based on the declines in photosynthesis and the identities of the differentially abundant proteins, we hypothesize that Ptr ToxB causes a rapid disruption in the photosynthetic processes of sensitive wheat, leading to the generation of ROS and oxidative stress. Although the photoprotective and repair mechanisms of the host appear to initially still be functional, they are probably overwhelmed by the continued production of ROS, leading to chlorophyll photooxidation and the development of chlorosis. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Our previous results demonstrated that ToLCJB-[ID:ID:03] is essential for induction of leaf curl symptoms in plants and transgene expression of its βC1 gene in Nicotiana benthamiana plants induces virus-like symptoms. Here we show that Ageratum yellow vein virus-Indonesia [Indonesia: Tomato] (AYVV-ID[ID:Tom]) alone could systemically infect the plants and induced upward leaf curl symptoms. ToLCJB-[ID:ID1:03] was required, in addition to AYVV-ID[ID:Tom], for induction of severe downward leaf curl disease in N. benthamiana plants. However, DNAβ01fsβC1, which encompasses a frameshift mutation, did not induce severe symptoms in N. benthamiana when co-inoculated with AYVV-ID[ID:Tom]. The infectivity analysis of AYVV-ID[ID:Tom] and its associated betasatellite encoded genes using Potato virus X (PVX) vector were carried out in N. benthamiana, indicate that the V2 and βC1 genes are symptom determinants. We have identified the DNA encoded V2 and its betasatellite, ToLCJB-[ID:ID1:03], encoded βC1 proteins as efficient silencing suppressors of posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) by using an Agrobacterium co-infiltration or heterologous PVX vector assays. However, the results also showed weak suppression of gene silencing activities for C2 and C4 induced by GFP and mRNA associated with GFP was detected. Furthermore, confocal imaging analysis of ToLCJB-[ID:ID1:03] βC1 in the epidermal cells of N. benthamiana shows that this protein is accumulated towards the periphery of the cell and around the nucleus, however, V2 accumulated in the cell cytoplasm, C4 associated with plasma membrane and C2 exclusively targeted into nucleus.

However, not all of the genes are transcribed and translated under any defined condition. The robustness that an organism exhibits to environmental perturbations is partly conferred by the genes that are constitutively expressed under all the conditions, and partly by a subset of genes that are induced under the defined conditions. The conditional importance of genes in conferring robustness can be understood in the context of the functional attributes of these genes and their correlations to the defined environmental conditions. However, a priori prediction of such genes for a given condition is yet not possible. We have attempted such predictions by integrating the available gene expression data with genome-wide functional linkages through the well known centrality-lethality correlations in graph theory. We make use of three distinct concepts of centrality, namely, degree, closeness and betweenness, which yield mutually complementary information. We then demonstrate the efficacy of combined graph theoretical and machine learning approaches in ranking essential nodes from a large network of genome-wide functional linkages, which yields predictions with high accuracy. We therefore perceive such predictions as highly useful in applications such as defining and prioritizing drug targets. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Escherichia Coli Proteins; Escherichia Coli Protein; Algorithm; Article; Bacterial Genome; Biological Model; Escherichia Coli; Gene; Genetics; Regression Analysis; Statistical Model; Algorithms; Escherichia Coli Proteins; Genes; Genome, Bacterial; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Regression Analysis","Escherichia coli protein; algorithm; article; bacterial genome; biological model; Escherichia coli; gene; genetics; regression analysis; statistical model; Algorithms; Escherichia coli Proteins; Genes; Genome, Bacterial; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Regression Analysis",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72949111817

Here we employed complementary proteomic methods to identify differentially regulated proteins early during a plant's defense response. Besides defense-related proteins, constituents of the largest category of upregulated proteins were cytoplasmic- and ER-residing molecular chaperones. Investigating the significance of upregulated ER chaperones, we find that silencing of ER-resident protein disulfide isomerases NbERp57 and NbP5 and the calreticulins NbCRT2 and NbCRT3 led to partial loss of N immune receptor-mediated defense against Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Furthermore, NbCRT2 and NbCRT3 were required for the expression of a previously uncharacterized induced receptor-like kinase (IRK).

Slicing triggered differentiation processes that lead to changes in metabolism, activation of defence and cell-wall reinforcement. Proteins related to storage, cell growth and division, cell structure, signal transduction, energy production, disease/defence mechanisms and secondary metabolism were detected. Image analysis of the 2-DE gels revealed a timedependent change in the complexity of the polypeptide patterns. By microscopic observation the polyalyphatic domain of suberin was clearly visible by D4, indicating that a closing layer (primary suberisation) was formed by then. A PCA of the six sampling dates revealed two time phases, D0-D2 and D4-D8, with a border position between D2 and D4. Moreover, a PCA of differentially expressed proteins indicated the existence of a succession of proteomic events leading to wound-periderm reconstruction. Some late-expressed proteins (D6-D8), including a suberisation-associated anionic peroxidase, have also been identified in the native periderm. Despite this, protein patterns of D8 slices and native periderm were still different, suggesting that the processes of wound-periderm formation are extended in time and not fully equivalent.

Biophysical models that integrate information about crop growing conditions can give early insight about the likely size of a crop. At a point scale, where highly detailed knowledge about environmental and management conditions are known, the performance of reputable crop modelling approaches like APSIM have been well established. However, regional growing conditions tend not to be homogenous. Heterogeneity is common in many agricultural systems, and particularly in sugarcane systems. To overcome this obstacle, hundreds of model settings ('models' for convenience) that represent different environmental and management conditions were created for Ayr, a major sugarcane growing region in north eastern Australia. Statistical data mining methods that used ensembles were used to select and assign weights to the best models. One technique, called a lasso approximation produced the best results. This procedure, produced a predictive correlation (rcv) of 0.71 when predicting end of season sugarcane yields some 4 months prior to the start of the harvest season, and 10 months prior to harvest completion. This continuous forecasting methodology based on statistical ensembles represents a considerable improvement upon previous research where only categorical forecast predictions had been employed.

Fruit and apple consumption is 100 kg and 20 kg/person/year, respectively. Apple varieties currently planted in Germany include 'Braeburn', 'Gala', 'Fuji' and 'Pinova', and 'Topaz' and 'Santana' in organic fruit orchards. Orchards are commonly spaced at 3×1 m resulting in 3,000-3,500 trees/ha. In recent years, fruit trees often flower earlier due to climate change with overhead sprinklers protecting them from late frosts. The decrease in honey bee populations led to research into managing wild native, individual (non-hive) bee species such as Osmia and Andrena or the use of imported frozen pollen in small single-variety plots. Research also examined alternatives to tar oil impregnated timber for tree stakes. Alternative impregnation oils, non impregnated Robinia poles with wire trellis and recyclable plastic poles are being investigated for stability and durability. Tree rows are usually treated with herbicides with research underway into organic mulching with shredded wood chippings from excavated apple trees, Miscanthus or communal plant-derived compost. Breakeven farmgate prices vary from 0.32 ε/kg class 1 'Jonagold' apples to 0.37 ε/kg for 'Elstar' apples. Many research objectives are aimed at sustainability and conserving resources like soil and water and cutting costs, particularly labour cost. Research is underway on mechanical thinning of apple flowers. This may aid or supersede chemical thinning, which is currently restricted to 2-3 compounds with temperature dependent efficacy. Hail nets are becoming more widespread due to increasing incidence of hail storms throughout the growing season. Physiological effects of hail nets include reductions in sunburn, flower initiation, fruit yield and colouration as well as increases in vegetative growth and spider mite populations. Research focuses on combating the light loss associated with hail nets using reflective mulches to overcome insufficient colouration in bi-coloured apple cultivars. Research also addresses approaches to estimate and predict yield using image analysis or laser scanners which will supersede traditional approaches based on fruit counts. New technology already provides non-invasive firmness and NIR-based sugar determination of apple fruit. Research is underway on its extension to acidity and internal fruit disorders. QS-GAP certification will supersede IP (Integrated Production) control practises. Bar code or RF ID tags will enable traceability of fruit to their origin and require a database of orchard management practises. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Apple; Climate Change; Compost; Eurep-gap; Food Miles; Hail Net; Honey Bee; Malus × Domestica; Mechanical Thinning; Yield Prediction; Acari; Apis Mellifera; Apoidea; Araneae; Malus; Malus X Domestica; Miscanthus; Osmia; Robinia; Tetranychidae,Acari; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Araneae; Malus; Malus x domestica; Miscanthus; Osmia; Robinia; Tetranychidae,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149123273

The genome of Xylella fastidiosa, the causal agent of Pierce's disease (PD) of grapevine, contains an operon that is strikingly similar to the X. campestris gum operon, which is responsible for the production of xanthan gum. Based on this information, it has been hypothesized that X. fastidiosa is capable of producing an EPS similar in structure and composition to xanthan gum but lacking the terminal mannose residue. In this study, we raised polyclonal antibodies against a modified xanthan gum polymer similar to the predicted X. fastidiosa EPS polymer. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to quantify production of EPS from X. fastidiosa cells grown in vitro and immunolocalization microscopy to examine the distribution of X. fastidiosa EPS in biofilms formed in vitro and in planta and assessed the contribution of X. fastidiosa EPS to the vascular occlusions seen in PD-infected grapevines.

Black point is undesirable to the malting industry and results in significant economic loss annually. To identify proteins associated with barley black point we utilised a proteomic approach with 2-DE to compare proteins from whole grain samples of black pointed and healthy grain. From this comparison two condition-specific proteins were identified: a novel 75 kDa late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein and a barley grain peroxidase 1 (BP1) that were specifically more abundant in healthy grain and black pointed grain, respectively. Although LEA protein was less abundant in black pointed grain, LEA gene expression was greater suggesting protein degradation had possibly occurred in black pointed grain. Similarly, the increase in BP1 in black pointed grain could not be explained by gene expression. Western blot analysis also revealed that the identified LEA protein is biotinylated in vivo.

This study investigated the importance of root morphological traits, especially root hairs, in plant growth and Zn uptake. Wild-type barley (Hordeum vulgare) Pallas and its root-hairless mutant brb were grown in soil and solution culture at different levels of Zn supply for 16 d. Root morphological traits (root length, diameter, and surface area) were measured using the WinRHIZOPro Image Analysis system. In soil culture, Pallas had greater shoot dry matter, shoot Zn concentration, shoot Zn content, and Zn uptake per cm2 root surface area than brb, primarily under zinc deficiency. Both Pallas and brb developed longer roots under Zn deficiency. Development of root hairs was not affected by plant Zn status. In solution culture, there were no significant genotypic differences in any of the parameters measured, indicating that mutation in brb does not affect growth and Zn uptake. However, both Pallas and brb developed longer and thinner roots, and root hair growth was less than in soil culture, and was not affected by plant Zn status. The better growth and greater Zn uptake of Pallas compared with brb in Zn-deficient soil can be attributed primarily to greater root surface area due to root hairs in Pallas rather than other root morphological differences. © 2007 The Author(s). © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Barley; Hordeum Vulgare; Root Hair; Root Morphology; Soil; Solution; Zinc Deficiency; Zinc Uptake; Zinc; Plant Proteins; Soil; Zinc; Image Analysis; Morphology; Soil Surveys; Zinc; Hordeum Vulgare; Root Hair; Root Morphology; Zinc Deficiency; Zinc Uptake; Crops; Vegetable Protein; Zinc; Article; Barley; Genetics; Genotype; Growth, Development And Aging; Histology; Metabolism; Physiology; Plant Root; Soil; Genotype; Hordeum; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Soil","Image analysis; Morphology; Soil surveys; Zinc; Hordeum vulgare; Root hair; Root morphology; Zinc deficiency; Zinc uptake; Crops; vegetable protein; zinc; article; barley; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; histology; metabolism; physiology; plant root; soil; Genotype; Hordeum; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Soil",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34848849044

Much recent work has focused on developing new representations for protein sequences, called string kernels, for use with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. However, while some of these approaches exhibit state-of-the-art performance at the binary protein classification problem, i.e. discriminating between a particular protein class and all other classes, few of these studies have addressed the real problem of multi-class superfamily or fold recognition. Moreover, there are only limited software tools and systems for SVM-based protein classification available to the bioinformatics community. Results: We present a new multi-class SVM-based protein fold and superfamily recognition system and web server called SVM-Fold, which can be found at http://svm-fold.c2b2.columbia.edu. Our system uses an efficient implementation of a state-of-the-art string kernel for sequence profiles, called the profile kernel, where the underlying feature representation is a histogram of inexact matching k-mer frequencies. We also employ a novel machine learning approach to solve the difficult multi-class problem of classifying a sequence of amino acids into one of many known protein structural classes. Binary one-vs-the-rest SVM classifiers that are trained to recognize individual structural classes yield prediction scores that are not comparable, so that standard ""one-vs-all"" classification fails to perform well. Moreover, SVMs for classes at different levels of the protein structural hierarchy may make useful predictions, but one-vs-all does not try to combine these multiple predictions. To deal with these problems, our method learns relative weights between one-vs-the-rest classifiers and encodes information about the protein structural hierarchy for multi-class prediction. In large-scale benchmark results based on the SCOP database, our code weighting approach significantly improves on the standard one-vs-all method for both the superfamily and fold prediction in the remote homology setting and on the fold recognition problem. Moreover, our code weight learning algorithm strongly outperforms nearest-neighbor methods based on PSI-BLAST in terms of prediction accuracy on every structure classification problem we consider. Conclusion: By combining state-of-the-art SVM kernel methods with a novel multi-class algorithm, the SVM-Fold system delivers efficient and accurate protein fold and superfamily recognition. © 2007 Melvin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Protein; Proteins; Efficient Implementation; Feature Representation; Machine Learning Approaches; Nearest Neighbor Method; Protein Classification; Protein Classification Problems; State-of-the-art Performance; Structure Classifications; Amino Acids; Bioinformatics; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Forecasting; Learning Algorithms; Protein Folding; Proteins; Support Vector Machines; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Computer Prediction; Computer Program; Histogram; Kernel Method; Learning Algorithm; Machine Learning; Molecular Systematics; Protein Analysis; Protein Database; Protein Determination; Protein Folding; Protein Structure; Structure Analysis; Support Vector Machine; Web Browser; Algorithm; Artificial Intelligence; Automated Pattern Recognition; Chemistry; Classification; Discriminant Analysis; Internet; Methodology; Molecular Genetics; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis; Sequence Homology; Protein; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Artificial Intelligence; Discriminant Analysis; Molecular Sequence Data; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Protein Folding; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Software","Efficient implementation; Feature representation; Machine learning approaches; Nearest neighbor method; Protein Classification; Protein classification problems; State-of-the-art performance; Structure classifications; Amino acids; Bioinformatics; Computer aided diagnosis; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Protein folding; Proteins; Support vector machines; amino acid sequence; article; computer prediction; computer program; histogram; kernel method; learning algorithm; machine learning; molecular systematics; protein analysis; protein database; protein determination; protein folding; protein structure; structure analysis; support vector machine; web browser; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; chemistry; classification; discriminant analysis; Internet; methodology; molecular genetics; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; sequence homology; protein; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Artificial Intelligence; Discriminant Analysis; Molecular Sequence Data; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Protein Folding; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Software",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447648188

Using a CYCB1;1::GUS construct, the re-initiation of infection-related cell division is shown from 4 days after inoculation on. Sensitivity to cytokinins and auxins as well as the endogenous hormone levels are evaluated. Both an enhanced cytokinin gene response and an accumulation of isopentenyl adenine and adenosine precede this re-initiation of cell division, whereas an enhanced auxin gene response is observed from 6 days after inoculation on. The alh1 mutant, impaired in the cross talk between ethylene and auxins, is resistant to P. brassicae. A differential protein analysis of infected versus noninfected roots and hypocotyls was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and quantitative image analysis, coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight-time of flight mass spectrometry-based protein identification. Of the visualized proteins, 12% show altered abundance compared with the noninfected plants, including proteins involved in metabolism, cell defense, cell differentiation, and detoxification. Combining the hormone and proteome data, we postulate that, at the very first stages of Plasmodiophora infection, plasmodial-produced cytokinins trigger a local re-initiation of cell division in the root cortex. Consequently, a de novo meristematic area is established that acts as a sink for host-derived indole-3-acetic acid, carbohydrates, nitrogen, and energy to maintain the pathogen and to trigger gall development. © 2006 The American Phytopathological Society. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Beta Glucuronidase; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cytokinins; Glucuronidase; Plant Growth Regulators; Arabidopsis Protein; Beta Glucuronidase; Cytokinin; Phytohormone; Arabidopsis; Article; Cell Division; Cytology; Fungus; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Innate Immunity; Meristem; Metabolism; Microbiology; Mutation; Pathogenicity; Physiology; Plant Disease; Plant Root; Promoter Region; Proteomics; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Division; Cytokinins; Fungi; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucuronidase; Immunity, Natural; Meristem; Mutation; Plant Diseases; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Roots; Promoter Regions (genetics); Proteomics; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Plasmodiophora; Plasmodiophora Brassicae","Arabidopsis protein; beta glucuronidase; cytokinin; phytohormone; Arabidopsis; article; cell division; cytology; fungus; gene expression regulation; genetics; innate immunity; meristem; metabolism; microbiology; mutation; pathogenicity; physiology; plant disease; plant root; promoter region; proteomics; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Division; Cytokinins; Fungi; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucuronidase; Immunity, Natural; Meristem; Mutation; Plant Diseases; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Roots; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Proteomics; Arabidopsis thaliana; Plasmodiophora; Plasmodiophora brassicae",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33751577022

This localization is completely abolished when the vacuolar iron uptake transporter VIT1 is disrupted. Vacuolar iron storage is also critical for seedling development because vit1-1 seedlings grow poorly when iron is limiting.

In addition, BSMV encodes a triple-gene block of movement proteins (TGBs) that putatively share functional roles with their counterparts in other hordei-, pomo- and pecluviruses, but detailed information on the intracellular locations of the individual TGBs is lacking. Here, the subcellular localizations of BSMV-encoded proteins TGB2 and γb fused to green or red fluorescent proteins were examined in epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana and barley (Hordeum vulgare 'Black Hulless'). The fusion proteins were expressed from a BSMV vector or under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The subcellular localizations were studied by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM). CLSM studies showed that both proteins were recruited to chloroplasts in the presence of viral RNA and that virus RNA, coat protein and γb protein were detected in plastid preparations from infected leaves. Electron microscope images of thin sections of virus-infected leaves revealed abnormal chloroplasts with cytoplasmic inclusions containing virus-like particles. In addition, cellular localizations of BSMV TGB2 suggest subtle differences in function between the hordei-like TGB2 proteins. The results indicate that TGB2 and γb proteins play a previously unknown functional role at the site of virus replication. © 2006 SGM. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Red Fluorescent Protein; Gamma(b) Protein, Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Rna, Viral; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Viral Proteins; Coat Protein; Green Fluorescent Protein; Hybrid Protein; Protein Gammab; Red Fluorescent Protein; Triple Gene Block Of Movement Protein 2; Unclassified Drug; Vegetable Protein; Virus Rna; Virus Vector; Article; Barley; Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus; Cauliflower Mosaic Virus; Cellular Distribution; Chloroplast; Confocal Laser Microscopy; Controlled Study; Cotyledon; Cytoplasm; Electron Microscopy; Epidermis Cell; Genetic Code; Image Analysis; Mosaic Virus; Nicotiana Benthamiana; Nonhuman; Plant; Plant Leaf; Plastid; Priority Journal; Promoter Region; Protein Expression; Protein Function; Viral Plant Disease; Virus Particle; Virus Replication; Artificial Gene Fusion; Blotting, Western; Chloroplasts; Genes, Reporter; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Hordeum; Inclusion Bodies, Viral; Microscopy, Confocal; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Mosaic Viruses; Plant Leaves; Protein Transport; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Rna, Viral; Tobacco; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Viral Proteins; Virus Replication; Dicotyledoneae; Hordeivirus; Hordeum Vulgare; Hordeum Vulgare Subsp.

After cesium sulfate density gradient centrifugation, they were separated into lighter top (T) and heavier bottom (B) components. T particles comigrated with host proteins, whereas B particles were concentrated in a cesium density typical for complete virions. Both particles were composed of two incomplete icosahedra of 11 capsomers each, but T particles were slightly larger (diameter, 22.5 nm) and less dense in the interior than B particles (diameter, 21.5 nm). T particles were frequently associated with small globules of ∼14 nm diameter of unknown origin. The overall structure of ACMV, a begomovirus transmitted by whiteflies, was similar to that of Maize streak virus (MSV), a mastrevirus transmitted by leafhoppers, although the vertices of the icosahedra were less pronounced. Models of ACMV coat proteins based on Satellite tobacco necrosis virus support the exposure of parts of the molecule essential for transmission specificity by whiteflies and provide possible structural explanations for the smaller protrusion of the ACMV capsid relative to MSV.

Changes in differentially displayed proteins were found in leaf sheaths after cutting in the 0-48 h time course. Ten proteins were up-regulated, while 19 proteins were down-regulated compared with those on the four 2-D gels. Among them, 14 proteins were analyzed by N-terminal, or internal amino acid sequence. The clear functions of nine proteins could be identified. Six proteins did not yield amino acid sequence information due to their blocked N-termini. Furthermore, 11 proteins were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and identified protein database matching. It was shown that the down-regulated proteins were calreticulin (nos. 5, 6), histone H1 (no. 15) and hemoglobin (no. 17), putative peroxidase (no. 19); the up-regulated proteins were Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitor (no. 23), putative receptor-like protein kinase (nos. 24, 25), calmodulin-related protein (no. 26), small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (no. 27), mannose-binding rice lectin (nos. 28, 29).

This structure, termed the β-hexamer, consists of six short β-strands. The β-hexamer was postulated to play a critical role in the assembly and stability of the virion by stabilizing hexameric capsomers (Speir et al., 1995). Mutational analyses of the β-hexamer structure, utilizing both in vitro and in vivo assembly assays, demonstrate that this structure is not required for virion formation devoid of nucleic acids in vitro or for RNA-containing virions in vivo. However, the β-hexamer structure does contribute to virion stability in vitro and modulates disease expression in vivo.

Herein, we show that the pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis uses different MT nucleation sites to rearrange MTs during the cell cycle. In vivo observation of green fluorescent protein-MTs and MT plus-ends, tagged by a fluorescent EB1 homologue, provided evidence for antipolar MT orientation and dispersed cytoplasmic MT nucleating centers in unbudded cells. On budding γ-tubulin containing MTOCs formed at the bud neck, and MTs reorganized with >85% of all minus-ends being focused toward the growth region. Experimentally induced lateral budding resulted in MTs that curved out of the bud, again supporting the notion that polar growth requires polar MT nucleation. Depletion or overexpression of Tub2, the γ-tubulin from U. maydis, affected MT number in interphase cells. The SPB was inactive in G2 phase but continuously recruited γ-tubulin until it started to nucleate mitotic MTs. Taken together, our data suggest that MT reorganization in U. maydis depends on cell cycle-specific nucleation at dispersed cytoplasmic sites, at a polar MTOC and the SPB. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Gamma Tubulin; Actins; Epitopes; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Kinesin; Luminescent Proteins; Tubulin; Gamma Tubulin; Green Fluorescent Protein; Article; Cell Budding; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle G2 Phase; Cell Growth; Cell Nucleus; Cell Polarity; Centrosome; Controlled Study; Cytosol; Fungus; Gene Overexpression; In Vivo Study; Interphase; Microtubule Assembly; Microtubule Organizing Center; Mitosis; Nonhuman; Pathogenicity; Plant; Priority Journal; Spindle Pole Body; Ustilago Maydis; Actins; Cell Division; Cell Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Epitopes; G1 Phase; Genotype; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Kinesin; Luminescent Proteins; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Microtubules; Mitosis; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Plant Diseases; Plasmids; Protein Binding; Recombination, Genetic; Time Factors; Tubulin; Ustilago; Eukaryota; Fungi","gamma tubulin; green fluorescent protein; article; cell budding; cell cycle; cell cycle G2 phase; cell growth; cell nucleus; cell polarity; centrosome; controlled study; cytosol; fungus; gene overexpression; in vivo study; interphase; microtubule assembly; microtubule organizing center; mitosis; nonhuman; pathogenicity; plant; priority journal; spindle pole body; Ustilago maydis; Actins; Cell Division; Cell Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Epitopes; G1 Phase; Genotype; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Kinesin; Luminescent Proteins; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Microtubules; Mitosis; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Plant Diseases; Plasmids; Protein Binding; Recombination, Genetic; Time Factors; Tubulin; Ustilago; Eukaryota; Fungi",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037329235

With the availability of the draft genome sequence of two major types, japonica- and indica-rice, ""rice proteomics"" has entered into the era of functional genomics. Although during the last decade an important but limited progress (mainly construction of protein datafiles) has been made in the field of rice proteomics, it is only recently that dedicated research groups have taken this challenge to systematically analyze the rice proteome at the cell (and organelle), tissue, and whole plant level. Important gains achieved by the accelerated technological progress in protein separation and identification will help in going beyond the simple cataloguing of rice proteins in realistic terms.

Mutagenesis experiments identified the βH-βI loop of the capsid subunit as a potential key motif responsible for interactions with the insect vector. To further examine the functional characteristics of this motif, we generated monoclonal antibodies that bound to native virions but not to βH-βI mutants. Fab fragments from these antibodies were complexed with wild-type CMV and the virus-Fab structure was determined to 12-Å resolution by using electron cryomicroscopy and image reconstruction techniques. The electron density attributed to the bound antibody has a turret-like appearance and protrudes from each of the 12 fivefold axes of the icosahedral virus. Thus, the antibody binds only to the pentameric clusters (pentons) of A subunits of the T=3 quasisymmetric virus and does not appear to bind to any of the B and C subunits that occur as hexameric clusters (hexons) at the threefold (quasi-sixfold) axes. Modeling and electron density comparisons were used to analyze the paratope-epitope interface and demonstrated that the antibody binds to three βH-βI loops in three adjacent A subunits in each penton. This antibody can discriminate between A and B/C subunits even though the βH-βI loop adopts the same structure in all 180 capsid subunits and is therefore recognizing differences in subunit arrangements. Antibodies with such character have potential use as probes of viral assembly. Our results may provide an additional rationale for designing synthetic vaccines by using symmetrical viral particles. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Viral; Capsid Proteins; Macromolecular Substances; Protein Subunits; Rna, Viral; Antigen Binding; Aphid; Article; Binding Kinetics; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Cucumber Mosaic Virus; Image Reconstruction; Molecular Interaction; Molecular Model; Molecular Recognition; Mutagenesis; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Protein Motif; Virion; Virus Assembly; Virus Capsid; Virus Transmission; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Viral; Aphids; Binding Sites; Capsid Proteins; Cucumovirus; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Insect Vectors; Macromolecular Substances; Microscopy, Electron; Mutation; Plant Diseases; Protein Subunits; Rna, Viral; Virus Assembly","antigen binding; aphid; article; binding kinetics; cryoelectron microscopy; Cucumber mosaic virus; image reconstruction; molecular interaction; molecular model; molecular recognition; mutagenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein motif; virion; virus assembly; virus capsid; virus transmission; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Viral; Aphids; Binding Sites; Capsid Proteins; Cucumovirus; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Insect Vectors; Macromolecular Substances; Microscopy, Electron; Mutation; Plant Diseases; Protein Subunits; RNA, Viral; Virus Assembly",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036889348

We previously cloned and characterized the small prototypical G protein, Ras, of C. trifolii, which is involved in the signaling pathways that mediate interaction between the pathogen and its host. Transformants expressing constitutively active forms of Ras have growth medium-dependent phenotypes. In nutrient-rich media (e.g., yeast extract and peptone), the phenotype of the transformants was indistinguishable from that of the wild type. However, during nutrient starvation, the transformants lose polarity, have distended hyphae, and fail to sporulate and produce appressoria. Since peptone caused the phenotype to revert, amino acids were tested singly and in combination to identify the responsible amino acid(s). We found that 1.6 mM proline in the medium reverses the constitutively active Ras phenotype. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Amino Acids; Culture Media; Proline; Ras Proteins; Amino Acids; Cloning; Proteins; Yeast; Pathogens; Microbiology; Amino Acid; Guanine Nucleotide Binding Protein; Peptone; Proline; Ras Protein; Microbiology; Amino Acid Analysis; Article; Colletotrichum; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Protein Expression; Amino Acids; Culture Media; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Medicago Sativa; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Proline; Ras Proteins; Bacteria (microorganisms); Colletotrichum Trifolii","Amino acids; Cloning; Proteins; Yeast; Pathogens; Microbiology; amino acid; guanine nucleotide binding protein; peptone; proline; Ras protein; microbiology; amino acid analysis; article; Colletotrichum; nonhuman; phenotype; protein expression; Amino Acids; Culture Media; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Medicago sativa; Phenotype; Plant Diseases; Proline; ras Proteins; Bacteria (microorganisms); Colletotrichum trifolii",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036204409

With 20 adult whiteflies per test plant, the CMGs from Africa were transmitted by all three of the African B. tabaci populations to 60-79% of the target plants. Indian cassava B. tabaci transmitted ICMV-[Tri] to 89% of the target plants. In contrast, Indian cassava B. tabaci transmitted EACMV-[Mtw] and Tanzanian cassava B. tabaci transmitted ICMV-[Tri] less than a tenth as often, even when using 50 adults per plant and with increased acquisition and inoculation access periods. The complete coat protein genes of the CMGs had sequences typical of their source viruses, the major differences occurring between those originating from India and Africa. Symptom severity of the CMGs was quantified precisely by both visual assessment and image analysis techniques. EACMV-[Mtw] and ACMV-[Nam] were the most and least damaging isolates with 15.4 and 10.0% of the leaf area diseased, respectively. In these tests the transmission frequency was not linked to symptom severity in the source plants.

Being able to predict likely yields will help producers plan and cost their resources at an operational factory level. It will also help them establish appropriate storage and distribution facilities. An article in Mapping Awareness February 1995 reported on a three-year project to predict sugar beet yields up to four months ahead of harvest for British Sugar, using satellite-based earth observation data integrated in a GIS. The project - sponsored by the British National Space Centre - is being carried out by a consortium, led by Logica UK and including British Sugar, Brooms Barn Experimental Station and the University of Nottingham. The results of the 1994 pre-operational trial, as well as the 1995 operational trial, have now been processed and analysed. The sugar beet project aimed to predict UK yields to within 0.75 tonnes per hectare for each factory catchment area during May, June, July and August for each year. In conjunction with Brooms Barn Experimental Station, British Sugar had previously managed to predict the entire UK crop to within 1.0 tonnes of sugar per hectare, using a helicopter survey and numerical modelling. The consortium's new yield prediction system is based around Intergraph GIS and image processing technology. We used vector field boundaries to extract a crop-cover-per field figure from the near-infrared and red bands of the satellite imagery. We also incorporated meteorological data acquired over the growing season in the yield model, together with historical weather records and soil data. Combined with other constant and variable factors influencing the sugar beet plant, this integrated approach gave us an estimate of the final yield at harvest. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

The trees have common plant disease symptoms, but the reason for the decline has never been identified. T. taxifolia's imminent extinction gains special poignancy through its close relationship to the pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), which produces the potent anticancer agent, taxol. Results: An examination of the endophytic fungal communities of wild torreyas consistently found a filamentous fungus, Pestalotiopsis microspora, associated with diseased trees and also with most symptomless trees. P. microspora can be cultured in the laboratory, and when it is introduced into greenhouse-grown torreyas, it causes disease symptoms similar to those seen in the field. The fungus can then be reisolated from these deliberately infected trees. The phytotoxins pestalopyrone, hydroxypestalopyrone and pestaloside have been isolated and characterized from axenic fungal cultures, and both pestalopyrone and hydroxypestalopyrone can be isolated from artificially infected torreyas. In addition, pestaloside has antifungal activity against other fungal endophytes of T. taxifolia. Conclusions: The filamentous fungus, P. microspora, has an endophytic-pathologic relationship with T. taxifolia. The fungus resides in the inner bark of symptomless trees, and physiological or environmental factors could trigger its pathological activity. P. microspora produces the phytotoxins pestalopyrone, hydroxypestalopyrone, and pestaloside which give rise to the disease. Pestaloside, which also has antifungal activity, could reduce competition from other fungal endophytes within the host. © 1995. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Endophyte; Pestalotiopsis Microspora; Phytotoxin; Torreya Taxifolia; Carbohydrates; Culture Media; Mycotoxins; Pyrones; Pestalopyrone; Fungi; Pestalotiopsis Microspora; Taxus Brevifolia; Torreya Taxifolia; Fungi Imperfecti; Carbohydrate; Mycotoxin; Pestalopyrone; Pyrone Derivative; Acetylation; Article; Chemistry; Culture Medium; Deuteromycetes; Fermentation; Image Processing; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; North America; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Pathogenicity; Plant Disease; Tree; Acetylation; Carbohydrates; Culture Media; Fermentation; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Mitosporic Fungi; Mycotoxins; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Plant Diseases; Pyrones; Trees","Fungi; Pestalotiopsis microspora; Taxus brevifolia; Torreya taxifolia; Fungi imperfecti; carbohydrate; mycotoxin; pestalopyrone; pyrone derivative; acetylation; article; chemistry; culture medium; Deuteromycetes; fermentation; image processing; isolation and purification; microbiology; North America; nuclear magnetic resonance; pathogenicity; plant disease; tree; Acetylation; Carbohydrates; Culture Media; Fermentation; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mitosporic Fungi; Mycotoxins; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Plant Diseases; Pyrones; Trees",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029410690

It goes on to explore the possibility of combining crop classification and yield prediction into a single network component, suitable for large-scale crop management. In the first part of the work, a small feasibility study of crop classification performance was carried out in two steps. First, prediction performance was evaluated using only monthly agro-met data (soil moisture, temperature, sunshine). Then the improvement in prediction performance after incorporating remote sensing data (Landsat TM) was measured. The standard error was 5% when TM data were included, versus 6% when TM was ignored. The CMAC neural network applied in this study has previously been successfully applied in two similar domains: real-time cloud classification on Meteosat data and mineral identification with airborne visible and infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. Two features peculiar to this classifier are that it handles mixtures naturally and that it is capable of returning a `don't know' response. It is natural therefore to consider the possibility of performing crop classification and yield prediction in a single step. We find that it is feasible to perform weekly combined classification and yield predictions for all of Europe, on a 1 km grid, for 100 different crops, using a cluster of five workstations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Agricultural Engineering; Image Analysis; Infrared Imaging; Neural Networks; Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller; Cmac Neural Network; Crop Classification; Crop Yield Prediction; Remote Sensing,Agricultural engineering; Image analysis; Infrared imaging; Neural networks; Cerebellar model articulation controller; CMAC neural network; Crop classification; Crop yield prediction; Remote sensing,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028736856
